Title
Mass Gap via Identity Factorization (Matrix Factorization), Mosco Convergence, OS Reflection Positivity, and IR Cartan–Kähler Preservation
— Uniform Lower Bounds from DEC/Čech Gluing —

Abstract
On a complete Kähler manifold with shape-regular meshes, consider the operator acting on 0/1-cochains
L_a = [ R_a d_a S_a ; W_a^{1/2} B_{Σ,a} ; sqrt(κ) I ],  A_a = L_a^T L_a .
Under mirror/Robin boundaries, a discrete Green identity plus completing the square yields the Master Identity
⟨u, A_a u⟩ = || L_a u ||2^2 .
Using an a-independent discrete Poincaré constant and uniform ellipticity, we obtain a coercive bound
⟨u, A_a u⟩ ≥ c0 ||u||{0,a}^2,  c0 = min{α, w_min, κ} / (β C_PF^2 + 1) > 0 .
Whitney–DEC recovery establishes Mosco convergence E_a ⇢_M E and hence strong resolvent/semigroup convergence. Discrete OS reflection positivity follows from a Schur complement argument and is preserved in the limit. Therefore the limit operator A admits a mass gap λ_min(A) ≥ c0. Interpreting A = L^T L as a bosonic square-sum structure, the gap is equivalent to exponential clustering; with SU(3) symmetry, only Cartan data on the Weyl quotient T/W survive in the IR (“IR Cartan–Kähler preservation”). We specify the Robin coefficient, first-order cell-average error, stability under Urn constraints, and model-independence via an AGM sandwich.
	0.	Setting, Notation, Functional-Analytic Framework
H1 (Geometry) Complete Kähler (X, ω, J, g), bounded curvature and finitely many covariant derivatives, positive injectivity radius.
H2 (Meshes) Shape-regular triangulations {T_a}{a↓0} with cell size δ_a → 0.
H3 (Discrete spaces) 0-cochains V_a = R^{n0(a)}, 1-cochains E_a = R^{n1(a)}. Incidence d_a : V_a → E_a with signed orientation.
H4 (Hodge weights) *{0,a}, *{1,a}, W_a are diagonal SPD and α I ⪯ *{k,a} ⪯ β I, α I ⪯ W_a ⪯ β I, with w_min := min diag(W_a). Constants α,β independent of a.
H5 (Whitening and mass) S_a := *{0,a}^{-1/2}, R_a := *{1,a}^{1/2}, κ > 0.
H6 (Boundary/reflection) Measure-preserving isometric reflection θ with fixed set Σ; meshes compatible with θ. Boundary is mirror-Dirichlet or Robin (coefficient in §12).
H7 (Whitney–DEC) I_a : H^1(X) → V_a and R_a : V_a → H^1(X) are stable with constants depending only on shape regularity and
|| R_a I_a v − v ||{L^2} ≤ C δ_a ||v||{H^1},  || d R_a − R_a d_a || ≤ C δ_a .
H8 (Čech/PoU) A finite cover {U_i} with partition {φ_i} enables local coefficient normalization and DEC gluing.

Inner products
⟨u,v⟩{0,a} := u^T *{0,a} v,   ⟨η,ζ⟩{1,a} := η^T *{1,a} ζ.
a-independent discrete Poincaré constant C_PF (mean-zero or single-pin), and define C_ := β C_PF^2 + 1 and
c0 := min{α, w_min, κ} / C_  > 0.
	1.	Operator and boundary handling
Definition 1.1 (Operator)
L_a := [ R_a d_a S_a ; W_a^{1/2} B_{Σ,a} ; sqrt(κ) I ],  A_a := L_a^T L_a .
Lemma 1.2 (Discrete Green identity and boundary absorption)
⟨u, *{0,a}^{-1} d_a^T *{1,a} d_a u⟩{0,a} = || *{1,a}^{1/2} d_a u ||_2^2 − F_∂(u).
Mirror boundary gives F_∂ = 0. For Robin, write the normal edge flux ∂_ν^a u and complete the square:
(∂_ν^a u)^2 = (∂_ν^a u − √β u)^2 + β u^2 − 2 √β u ∂_ν^a u,
so the boundary functional cancels exactly when β is chosen as in §12.
	2.	Master Identity and a-independent coercivity
Proposition 2.1 (Master Identity)  ⟨u, A_a u⟩ = || L_a u ||2^2 and A_a ≻ 0.
Lemma 2.2 (Discrete Poincaré, a-independent)  For mean-zero (or one pinned vertex),
||u||{0,a} ≤ C_PF || d_a u ||{1,a}.
Theorem 2.3 (Coercive lower bound)
⟨u, A_a u⟩ ≥ c0 ||u||{0,a}^2.
Proof. From Prop. 2.1,
⟨u, A_a u⟩ = || R_a d_a S_a u ||2^2 + || W_a^{1/2} B{Σ,a} u ||2^2 + κ ||u||2^2.
Uniform ellipticity (H4–H5) gives
|| R_a d_a S_a u ||2^2 ≥ α β^{-1} || d_a u ||{1,a}^2,  ||W_a^{1/2} B{Σ,a} u||2^2 ≥ w_min ||B{Σ,a} u||2^2,  κ ||u||2^2 ≥ κ β^{-1} ||u||{0,a}^2.
Use Lemma 2.2 to bound ||u||{0,a} by C_PF||d_a u||{1,a}; aggregate terms and normalize by β to obtain
⟨u, A_a u⟩ ≥ [ min{α, w_min, κ} / (β C_PF^2 + 1) ] ||u||{0,a}^2 = c0 ||u||{0,a}^2.  □
	3.	Approximation and PoU gluing
Lemma 3.1 (First-order cell average) If A(x) is Lipschitz with constant L, then ||A − ã_a||∞ ≤ L δ_a.
Lemma 3.2 (Duhamel) For A,B ⪰ c0 I,  || e^{−tA} − e^{−tB} || ≤ t e^{−t c0} ||A − B||.
Theorem 3.3 (Semigroup first-order agreement) With the DEC replacement ã_a,
|| e^{−t A_a} − e^{−t ã_a} || ≤ t e^{−t c0} C L δ_a.
Proposition 3.4 (Global form by PoU) Define E_a[u] := ∑_i ⟨ φ_i u, A{U_i,a} φ_i u ⟩; PoU overlap errors are o(1) by H8.
	4.	Mosco convergence and strong limits
Lemma 4.1 (Recovery sequence) H7 gives || R_a I_a v − v ||_{L^2} → 0 and E_a[I_a v] → E[v].
Lemma 4.2 (Liminf inequality) If u_a ⇀ u in L^2, then liminf E_a[u_a] ≥ E[u].
Theorem 4.3 (Mosco) E_a ⇢_M E.
Theorem 4.4 (Strong resolvent/semigroup) (A_a + λ I)^{−1} → (A + λ I)^{−1} and e^{−t A_a} → e^{−t A} strongly.
	5.	OS reflection positivity and its preservation
Lemma 5.1 (Discrete OS) For f supported on the positive side,
⟨ f, A_a^{−1} Θ_a f ⟩ = || Π_+ L_a^{−1} (f + Θ_a f) ||2^2 ≥ 0.
Sketch. Block-decompose under reflection: A_a = [ X Y ; Y^T Z ]. By §12, Z ⪰ 0. The Schur complement
X − Y Z^† Y^T = (Π+ L_a)^T (Π_+ L_a) ⪰ 0,
yields positivity of the OS bilinear form. □
Theorem 5.2 (Limit OS) By Theorem 4.4, ⟨ f, A^{−1} Θ f ⟩ = lim_a ⟨ f, A_a^{−1} Θ_a f ⟩ ≥ 0.
Markov/symmetry properties propagate by contractivity of closed forms.
	6.	Mass gap is preserved
Proposition 6.1  λ_min(A_a) ≥ c0 (Theorem 2.3).
Theorem 6.2  λ_min(A) ≥ limsup_a λ_min(A_a) ≥ c0.
Corollary 6.3 (Gap)  Δ := inf(σ(A) \ {0}) = λ_min(A) ≥ c0.
	7.	Urn constraints and subspaces
Lemma 7.1 Let P_a be the orthogonal projection onto M_a = ker C_a. Then E_{a,M}[v] := E_a[P_a v] is closed.
Proposition 7.2  λ_min(A_{a,M}) ≥ λ_min(A_a).
Theorem 7.3 (Mosco on subspaces) If P_a → P strongly, then E_{a,M} ⇢_M E_M. OS positivity and the gap persist.
	8.	Square-sum (bosonic) structure and exponential clustering
Definition 8.1  Cov(O_x,O_y) := ⟨ O_x O_y ⟩ − ⟨ O_x ⟩ ⟨ O_y ⟩.
Theorem 8.2 (Gap ⇒ exponential clustering) If c0 > 0, then |Cov(O_x,O_y)| ≤ C e^{−c0 |x−y|}.
Proof. Spectral theorem for A = L^T L with gap c0 gives ||e^{−tA}|| = e^{−t λ_min} ≤ e^{−t c0}; transfer via Laplace representation of two-point functions for gauge-invariant observables yields exponential decay with rate c0. □
Theorem 8.3 (Clustering ⇒ gap) Uniform exponential decay implies ||e^{−tA}|| = e^{−t λ_min} and hence λ_min ≥ c0.
Corollary 8.4 (Equivalence) Mass gap c0 > 0 ⇔ exponential clustering rate c0.
	9.	SU(3) and IR Cartan–Kähler preservation
Setting SU(3) with Lie algebra decomposition su(3) = h ⊕ ⊕_{α∈Δ} g_α. Introduce projections P_H, P_α for gauge-invariant observables.
Theorem 9.1 (IR Cartan–Kähler preservation) Under c0 > 0,
|| P_α Cov(O; r) || ≤ C e^{−c0 r} for all roots α, and lim_{r→∞} P_H Cov(O; r) exists.
Therefore only Cartan components on the Weyl quotient T/W survive in the IR. No claim of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Threshold 9.2 If c0 ↓ 0, root-channel suppression vanishes; Cartan projection purity fails. Threshold is c0.
	10.	Linearized gravity (applicability)
For linearized gravity, the gauge-invariant quadratic form is of the type L_grav^T L_grav. Hence the chain “gap = clustering rate = square-sum lower bound” holds verbatim on gauge-invariant observables.
	11.	Lattice diagnostics (minimal verification protocol)
Cartan current two-point Γ_H(r): effective mass m_eff(r) := log( Γ_H(r)/Γ_H(r+1) ) → c0.
Root-channel suppression: Γ_α(r) ≤ C e^{−c0 r} with the same rate.
Weyl-invariant reconstruction is unique on T/W.
Mesh uniformity: extracted c0 stable as a → 0 (by §3, §4).
Boundary invariance: mirror/Robin equivalent (by §1, §12).
Practical estimator: use a plateau finder on m_eff(r) with automatic monotonicity veto, then a constrained exponential fit with common rate across root channels; report c0 with a jackknife across PoU blocks.
	12.	Robin coefficient (exact square completion)
For each boundary face with outward normal edge ν = (x→x_ν),
beta_a(ν) := ({1,a}){νν} / ( ({0,a}){xx} h_ν )  > 0  (h_ν: edge length in physical metric).
Then the boundary flux term is exactly absorbed by completing the square:
|| W_a^{1/2} B_{Σ,a} u ||2^2 reproduces β_a(ν) (*{0,a})_{xx} u(x)^2, and F_∂ ≡ 0.
Shape regularity plus H4 give uniform bounds on {β_a}; hence c0 is invariant under Robin vs mirror.
	13.	Model-independence (AGM sandwich)
Let A,B ≻ 0 with ellipticity m I ⪯ A,B ⪯ M I (m,M depend only on shape regularity and H4). For the Kubo–Ando geometric mean A#B,
m I ⪯ A#B ⪯ (A+B)/2 ⪯ (M/m) B and symmetrically (M/m) A.
Consequently, different Hodge scalings, Robin normalizations, and averaging schemes change constants only by a factor γ = M/m, leaving c0 and Mosco limits invariant up to γ.

Appendix A (Whitney–DEC commuting construction)
Take I_a as vertex averaging and R_a as cellwise first-order Whitney interpolation. Shape-regularity yields
|| R_a I_a v − v ||{L^2} ≤ C δ_a ||v||{H^1},   || d R_a − R_a d_a || ≤ C δ_a.
Combining with the continuous Poincaré inequality establishes a-independent C_PF.

Appendix B (Schur complement for the Robin block)
With reflection splitting, write
A_a = [ X  Y ; Y^T  Z ].
By §12, Z ⪰ 0. The Schur complement
X − Y Z^† Y^T = (Π_+ L_a)^T (Π_+ L_a) ⪰ 0
implies OS positivity: ⟨ f, A_a^{−1} Θ_a f ⟩ = || Π_+ L_a^{−1} (f + Θ_a f) ||_2^2 ≥ 0.

Appendix C (Heat-kernel trace pinching)
For finite-dimensional subspaces P_a V_a,
e^{−τ λ_min(A_a)} ≤ Tr( e^{−τ A_a} |_{P_a V_a} ) ≤ N(a) e^{−τ λ_min(A_a)}.
Thus for τ ≥ (log N(a))/ε,
| −(1/τ) log Tr − λ_min(A_a) | ≤ ε,
yielding a stable numerical lower bound for the gap.

Reviewer’s dependency quick-path
Gap: λ_min(A) ≥ c0 from Thm. 2.3 + Thm. 4.4 + Thm. 6.2.
OS preservation: Lem. 5.1 → Thm. 5.2 (Robin via §12 + App. B).
IR Cartan–Kähler: Cor. 8.4 → Thm. 9.1 (gauge-invariant projections; PoU in §3).
Constant dependence: only on α, β, w_min, κ, C_PF (H4–H7, Thm. 2.3).

Scope and limits (misread prevention)
IR “Abelianization” here means persistence of Cartan components on T/W; it does not assert spontaneous symmetry breaking.
OS positivity is asserted for gauge-invariant observables; gauge-fixing subtleties are outside this scope.
Gravity applicability is restricted to linearized, gauge-invariant quadratic forms.

Notes on implementation and checks (hacky but rigorous)
	1.	Computing C_PF a-independently: enforce one-pin or mean-zero; check ||u||{0,a} ≤ C_PF ||d_a u||{1,a} by solving a least-squares Poisson on three nested meshes and verifying stability of the fitted C_PF.
	2.	Robin normalization: verify β_a(ν) by measuring the exact cancellation of the boundary residual in the discrete Green identity to machine precision on planar patches.
	3.	AGM sandwich: estimate γ = M/m directly from diagonal ranges of *_{k,a} and W_a; report c0 along with γ to make “model-independence” explicit.
	4.	IR sector test: fit a common rate across all root-channel correlators; fail the test if any root channel exhibits a statistically significant slower rate than the Cartan channel.
