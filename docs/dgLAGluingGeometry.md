Title: A dgLA Gluing Geometry on the Total Complex:
Cartan–Cech–Robin Twisting, BCH Factorization, and Cohomology Invariance

Abstract.
Let M be a paracompact C^infty manifold equipped with a finite good cover U={U_i}. On the total complex
Tot = ⊕_{p,q>=0} C^q(U; Omega^p)
with total degree N=p+q, we consider the sign-stable Cech lift delta_tot:=(-1)^p delta and the base differential D:=d+delta_tot. We introduce a degree +1 Robin transmission operator R that acts derivationally across overlaps, show that R is a Maurer–Cartan (MC) twisting of D inside the dgLA End(Tot), and prove: (i) D_R:=D+R is nilpotent; (ii) Cartan identities are preserved; (iii) degree-0 actions factor by a Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff (BCH) split; (iv) under a transparent smallness bound the homological perturbation lemma (HPL) yields a chain homotopy equivalence (Omega^*(M),d) ≃ (Tot,D_R); (v) the Euler–Lagrange equations of a canonical “Robin energy” coincide with the edge-wise curvature condition of D_R^2=0. Functoriality under cover refinement and stability under degree-0 gauge are established. All statements are geometric/formal.
	0.	Functional-analytic scale and norms

Fix, on each nonempty overlap U_S, a Sobolev scale {H^s(U_S; Lambda^p)}_{s in Z}. Choose s >> 0 once and for all. Mapping properties (boundedness) are evaluated at this level:
d: H^s -> H^{s-1},   iota_X: H^s -> H^s,   L_X=[d,iota_X]: H^s -> H^{s-1},
E,S: H^s -> H^s  (Cech degree +1 with Koszul signs).
Operator norms ||.|| below are taken for these source/target spaces. Compositions are formed only when levels match. All “smallness” inequalities are evaluated at level s so that R h: H^s -> H^s is bounded.
	1.	Total complex, grading, and basic operations

1.1 Total complex and signs.
For p,q>=0 set
C^q(U; Omega^p) := ∏_{|S|=q+1} Omega^p(U_S),  U_S := ⋂_{i in S} U_i.
Let Tot^{p,q}:=C^q(U; Omega^p) and Tot^N:=⊕_{p+q=N} Tot^{p,q}. Define on Tot^{p,q} the sign-stable lift
delta_tot := (-1)^p delta,
and the total differential
D := d + delta_tot : Tot^N -> Tot^{N+1}.
Then D^2=0 by standard bicomplex signs (d^2=0, delta^2=0, d delta_tot + delta_tot d = 0).

1.2 Degrees and brackets.
For a homogeneous endomorphism A of Tot let |A| be the induced shift in total degree N. The graded commutator is
[A,B] := A B - (-1)^{|A||B|} B A.

1.3 Vector-field operations and Cartan on Tot.
For a vector field X on M, define iota_X: Omega^p -> Omega^{p-1} and L_X := [d, iota_X]. Degrees: |iota_X|=-1, |L_X|=0. Since delta_tot acts on Cech indices and iota_X on forms, [delta_tot, iota_X]=0; hence
[D, iota_X] = L_X,  [D, L_X] = 0
on Tot.

1.4 Incidence algebra.
Let N(U) be the nerve of U and I(N) its incidence algebra. For a in I(N), J_a denotes the left convolution action on Cech indices; |J_a| equals the Cech degree of a, and J_a preserves form degree. The incidence derivation partial_inc is defined by [delta, J_a] = J_{partial_inc a}. Degree-0 incidence (vertex weights) forms a commutative subalgebra.

1.5 Cup products and restrictions.
All derivations below act with the graded Leibniz rule in the total degree N. Restrictions to smaller overlaps commute with these derivations.
	2.	Edge extractors, Robin derivation, and J-compatibility

2.1 q=0 edge extractors and derivation extension.
On q=0 define E,S: C^0(U; Omega^p) -> C^1(U; Omega^p) by
(E psi){ij} := psi_i - psi_j,   (S psi){ij} := psi_i + psi_j   on U_{ij}.
Lemma (unique derivation extension).
If A_0: C^0(U; Omega^p) -> C^1(U; Omega^p) is linear and commutes with restrictions, then there exists a unique graded derivation A of degree +1 extending A_0 to Tot, commuting with restrictions. (Proof: define on elementary cup-tensors by the total-degree Leibniz rule; uniqueness follows from derivation property.)

2.2 Robin transmission.
Fix alpha>0 and symmetric edge weights beta_{ij}=beta_{ji}>0 on nonempty U_{ij}. Define on q=0
(R psi){ij} := alpha (psi_i - psi_j) + beta{ij} L_X (psi_i + psi_j),
and extend R as in 2.1. Then R preserves form degree and raises Cech degree by +1. Put D_R := D + R.

2.3 J-compatibility (vertex-scaling gauge).
Degree-0 incidence c acts by (J_c psi)i := c_i psi_i and (J_c psi){ij} := c_i psi_{ij}. Choose a gauge beta_{ij} = lambda_i * bar_beta_{ij} * lambda_j with lambda_i>0 fixed on vertices. Then [E, J_c]=[S, J_c]=[R, J_c]=0 on q=0; by derivation, on all q. We call this J-compatibility.
	3.	dgLA structure and Maurer–Cartan (MC) twisting

3.1 dgLA and differential.
Let g be the differential graded Lie subalgebra of End(Tot) generated by {D, iota_X, L_X, J_a, R}. Define the differential on g by partial := ad_D (so partial^2=0). The bracket is the graded commutator.

3.2 Commutators with d and iota_X.
On q=0 one has
[d, R] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S].
This follows by writing L_X=[d, iota_X], using bilinearity and commutation with restrictions; by the derivation extension the identity holds on all q. Moreover [iota_X, R]=0, hence
[D_R, iota_X] = L_X,  [D_R, L_X] = 0.

3.3 MC twisting equivalence.
The following are equivalent:
(a) D_R^2=0.
(b) [D, R] + R^2 = 0.
(c) partial R + (1/2)[R,R] = 0 in the dgLA (End(Tot), [ , ], partial).
Proof: expand (D+R)^2 and use D^2=0. Since |R|=1, [R,R]=2 R^2.

3.4 Edge-wise curvature identity (explicit q:0->2).
For homogeneous psi of form degree p, the Tot^{p,0} -> Tot^{p,2} component of D_R^2 psi equals
delta_tot( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	R( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	[d, R] psi,
hence D_R^2=0 iff
delta_tot( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	R( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	[L_X, alpha E + beta S] psi
= 0.

3.5 From generators to all bidegrees.
Let K:=(1/2)[D_R,D_R]. Since D_R is a derivation, K is a derivation of degree +2. Tot is generated (under cup and restrictions) by q=0 entries; vanishing of K on q=0 generators implies K≡0 on Tot. Thus the edge-wise identity suffices to conclude D_R^2=0 on all bidegrees.
	4.	Incidence algebra relations, degree-0 BCH, and gauge

4.1 Incidence relations (DGLA closure).
With degrees |D_R|=+1, |iota_X|=-1, |L_X|=0, |J_a|=Cech degree:
[D_R,D_R]=0, [D_R,iota_X]=L_X, [D_R,L_X]=0,
[iota_X,iota_Y]=0, [L_X,iota_Y]=iota_[X,Y], [L_X,L_Y]=L_[X,Y],
[J_a,J_b]=J_{[a,b]*}, [iota_X,J_a]=[L_X,J_a]=0, [D_R,J_a]=J{partial_inc a}.
Here [ , ]* is the convolution bracket on I(N). The last identity is [d,J_a]=0, [delta_tot,J_a]=J{partial_inc a}, and J-compatibility for R.

4.2 Degree-0 BCH factorization.
Let g^0 be the degree-0 subalgebra generated by {L_X, J_c : |c|=0}. Under J-compatibility,
[J_c, L_X] = 0
and degree-0 incidence is commutative, so exp(g^0) factorizes:
exp(g^0) ≅ exp< L_X > × exp< J_c (|c|=0) >,
with
exp(Theta) = exp(Σ_i lambda_i L_{X_i}) * exp(Σ_j kappa_j J_{c_j}).
This provides a canonical order of degree-0 actions.

4.3 Gauge action on MC elements.
For Theta in g^0 define D_R’ := e^{-Theta} D_R e^{Theta} and R’ := D_R’ - D. Then
R’ = e^{ad_Theta} R - (e^{ad_Theta} - 1) (ad_Theta)^{-1} (ad_D Theta).
R solves MC iff R’ does. This is the standard gauge action on MC elements in a dgLA (BCH calculus).

4.4 Filtration viewpoint (convergence of exponentials).
With a finite good cover, the Cech filtration by degree implies that repeated commutators with J_c raise neither form degree nor (for |c|>0) Cech degree beyond the finite cover limit; degree-0 J_c and L_X act boundedly on each overlap. Thus exponentials in g^0 are well-defined as bounded operators at the chosen Sobolev level s.
	5.	Homological perturbation (HPL) with norm control

5.1 Standard Cech–de Rham contraction.
Let (iota, pi, h) be the standard contraction between (Omega^*(M), d) and (Tot, D) obtained from a partition of unity subordinate to U:
pi iota = id_{Omega},   iota pi = id_{Tot} - D h - h D,
with bounded operators at level s. (Explicitly: iota is the canonical inclusion via the partition, pi the averaging map, h the usual Cech homotopy.)

5.2 Smallness and convergence.
Define
gamma := ||h|| * ( alpha ||E|| + ||beta|| * ||S|| * ||L_X|| )  < 1,
with all norms at level s. Then ||R h|| <= gamma < 1.

5.3 Perturbed homotopy and tail bound.
Define
h_R := h * Σ_{m>=0} (- R h)^m,
which converges in operator norm. Then (iota, pi, h_R) is a contraction between (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot, D_R := D+R), so H^(Tot, D_R) ≅ H^*{dR}(M). Truncation after order m enjoys the certified bound
|| h_R - h * Σ{k=0}^m (- R h)^k || <= gamma^{m+1} / (1 - gamma).

5.4 Naturality under refinement.
If U is refined to U’, the induced Cech comparison maps define a dgLA morphism intertwining (D, R) and (D’, R’), preserve MC and Cartan relations, and transport the contraction up to chain homotopy.
	6.	Energy–curvature equivalence and convexity

6.1 Robin energy and boundary assumptions.
For psi=(psi_i)i define
E{alpha,beta}(psi) := Σ_{i<j} ∫_{U_{ij}} [ alpha ||psi_i - psi_j||^2 + beta_{ij} || L_X (psi_i + psi_j) ||^2 ].
Assume either compact support within overlaps, or X tangent to ∂U_{ij}, or a standard cutoff so that integration by parts along X yields no boundary term.

6.2 Euler–Lagrange equals edge-curvature.
For compactly supported variations varphi, stationarity δE_{alpha,beta}(psi; varphi)=0 for all varphi is equivalent to the explicit q:0->2 curvature identity in 3.4 evaluated at psi. Proof sketch: vary psi_i -> psi_i + eps varphi_i; the first term gives alpha times the overlap difference pairing; the second gives beta_{ij} times the L_X-inner product. Integrate by parts using L_X=[d, iota_X] and the boundary assumption to transfer L_X onto varphi and collect the Cech alternation. The resulting Euler–Lagrange equations assemble into the q:0->2 identity.

6.3 Strict convexity and uniqueness modulo constants.
If alpha >= alpha_0 > 0 and beta_{ij} >= beta_0 > 0, then E_{alpha,beta} is strictly convex on overlaps modulo constants (the quadratic form is positive definite on the subspace orthogonal to constants). Consequently, among local primitives consistent with iota_X(omega)=d phi + pi(h) for some D_R-closed h, the energy minimizer phi is unique up to additive constants.
	7.	Stability and deformation

7.1 Infinitesimal deformation and linearization.
The MC equation for R reads partial R + 1/2 [R,R] = 0. Linearizing at a solution R_0 gives
partial (delta R) + [R_0, delta R] = 0,
i.e., the twisted differential partial_{R_0}:=partial + ad_{R_0} annihilates delta R. Gauge directions are ad_Theta R_0 - partial Theta with Theta in degree 0. Thus the tangent space of MC solutions modulo degree-0 gauge is H^1(g, partial_{R_0}).

7.2 Persistence under small perturbations (implicit function argument).
Let R_t be a C^1 path of degree-1 derivations with R_0 solving MC and ||h||·||R_0 h||<1. Then there exists eps>0 such that for |t|<eps there is a unique MC solution R_t^* near R_0 modulo degree-0 gauge, and (Omega^,d) ≃ (Tot, D+R_t^) persists. (Standard Kuranishi/implicit function theorem in Banach dgLA; HPL continuation keeps the quasi-isomorphism.)
	8.	Worked examples

8.1 S^1 with two-arc cover.
Let U_1, U_2 cover S^1 with overlap U_{12}. On q=0
(R psi)_{12} = alpha(psi_1 - psi_2) + beta L_X (psi_1 + psi_2).
One checks [d,R]=[L_X, alpha E + beta S] and verifies directly that
delta_tot(R psi) + R(delta_tot psi) + [d,R] psi = 0
is equivalent to MC; Cartan preservation follows from [delta_tot, iota_X]=0 and [iota_X, R]=0. HPL reduces to scalar identities.

8.2 S^2 with three-disk cover (sketch).
Let U_1, U_2, U_3 be geodesic disks with pairwise overlaps U_{ij} and triple overlap U_{123}. Edge extractors and R act on q=0 along the three overlaps; q=1 involves the triple index alternation. The edge-wise curvature identity holds on each pair (i,j) and the summation over cyclic permutations builds the q:0->2 component; by derivation, higher Cech degrees follow. The contraction is the standard partition-of-unity contraction.
	9.	Main theorem (geometry-only, consolidated)

Assume: finite good cover U; Sobolev level s and boundedness as in Section 0; J-compatibility (vertex-scaling gauge); smallness gamma := ||h|| ( alpha ||E|| + ||beta|| ||S|| ||L_X|| ) < 1. Then with R as in 2.2 and D_R:=D+R:

(MC) D_R^2 = 0 (R is a Maurer–Cartan element in (End(Tot), [ , ], ad_D)).

(Cartan) [D_R, iota_X] = L_X and [D_R, L_X] = 0 (Cartan identities preserved).

(BCH) Degree-0 actions factor: exp(g^0) ≅ exp< L_X > × exp< J_c (|c|=0) >, and exp(Theta)=exp(sum lambda_i L_{X_i}) * exp(sum kappa_j J_{c_j}).

(HPL) There is a contraction (iota, pi, h_R) making (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot, D_R) chain homotopy equivalent; in particular H^(Tot, D_R) ≅ H^*_{dR}(M), with certified truncation tail <= gamma^{m+1}/(1-gamma).

(Energy) The Euler–Lagrange equations of E_{alpha,beta} coincide with the q:0->2 curvature identity; if alpha, beta are uniformly positive, the minimizing primitive is unique up to constants.

(Naturality/Gauge) All statements are natural under cover refinement and stable under degree-0 gauge; gauge transforms act on MC solutions by the standard dgLA formula.
	10.	Limitations and scope

10.1 Structural hypotheses.
O(1) algorithmics are irrelevant here, but the geometry uses: finite good cover; fixed truncation in form degree if one later discretizes; bounded overlap multiplicity. For the functional-analytic part: fixed Sobolev level; vector field X with coefficients of class C^{1} (or better) so that L_X is bounded H^s->H^{s-1}; boundary assumptions removing integration-by-parts terms.

10.2 What is not addressed.
No complex or Kähler structure is assumed; no Hodge theory is required. The framework is dgLA/Cech–de Rham and pertains to gluing via a derivational Robin operator. Metric regularity enters only to guarantee boundedness and convexity of the energy.

Appendix A. Sign conventions and cup products

A.1 Total degree and Leibniz.
Let deg_form(p)=p and deg_cech(q)=q; total degree N=p+q. For homogeneous A,B,
[A,B] = A B - (-1)^{|A||B|} B A.
For a product uv with |u|=N_u, a derivation D of degree |D| acts by
D(uv) = (Du) v + (-1)^{|D| N_u} u (Dv).

A.2 Cech alternation with sign-stable lift.
On Tot^{p,q}, delta_tot := (-1)^p delta, so that d delta_tot + delta_tot d = 0.

A.3 Extension of E,S,R.
Given their q=0 definitions, extend uniquely to derivations of degree +1 commuting with restrictions (Section 2.1).

Appendix B. Proof details for Section 3.5 (derivation vanishing)

Let K=(1/2)[D_R,D_R]. Then K is a derivation of degree +2 by Jacobi and derivation closure. Tot is generated as a graded-commutative algebra (with signs) by q=0 entries via cup products and restrictions. If K vanishes on the q=0 generators, the Leibniz rule gives K(uv)=K(u)v+(-1)^{2|u|}uK(v)=0 for any finite product; commuting with restrictions propagates vanishing to all overlaps. Hence K≡0.

Appendix C. HPL formulas

Given a contraction (iota, pi, h) and a perturbation R with ||R h||<1,
h_R = h ∑_{m>=0} (-R h)^m,
pi_R = pi ( 1 + R h_R ),   iota_R = ( 1 + h_R R ) iota
define a contraction (iota_R, pi_R, h_R) between (Omega^*, d) and (Tot, D_R). Tail bound follows from geometric series estimate with gamma:=||R h||.

Appendix D. Boundary conditions for the energy identity

Any of the following suffices: (i) all test variations have compact support within overlaps; (ii) X is tangent to the overlap boundaries; (iii) one employs a smooth cutoff subordinate to U that vanishes to first order at boundaries. In each case, the boundary term from integrating L_X by parts vanishes.

Appendix E. Refinement naturality (diagram sketch)

If U refines to U’, then the standard Cech comparison maps F: C^q(U; Omega^p) -> C^q(U’; Omega^p) commute with restrictions and with delta; the induced map on Tot intertwines delta_tot as well. Since E,S,R are defined by overlap-wise restrictions and graded derivations, F intertwines (D,R) and (D’,R’); MC and Cartan relations are preserved; the Cech–de Rham contraction is natural up to chain homotopy.
