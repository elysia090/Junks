Title: A Cartan–Cech–Robin–Urn Calculus: Differentials, Brackets, and O(1) Gluing on the Total Complex
	1.	Setting and notation

Let M be a paracompact C^\infty manifold and U = {U_i}{i=1}^P a finite good cover. For p,q >= 0 set
C^q(U; Omega^p) := product over |S| = q+1 of Omega^p(U_S), where U_S := intersection{i in S} U_i.
Define Tot^N := direct_sum over p+q = N of C^q(U; Omega^p).

Let d be the exterior derivative (raises form degree p by +1). Let delta be the Cech coboundary (raises Cech degree q by +1). To avoid sign ambiguities on Tot we fix
delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta acting on the summand of form degree p,
and we work with the total differential
D := d + delta_tot : Tot^N -> Tot^{N+1}.

For a vector field X, let iota_X : Omega^p -> Omega^{p-1} be contraction and L_X := [d, iota_X] the Lie derivative. All brackets are graded commutators:
[A,B] := A B - (-1)^{|A|*|B|} B A, where |A| is the cohomological degree shift induced by A.

Let N be the nerve of the cover, I(N) its incidence algebra. For a in I(N) write J_a for the left convolution action on Cech indices. If a has Cech degree r then |J_a| = r and J_a preserves form degree.

Cup products and restrictions use standard Koszul signs. All operators stated to be derivations act with the usual graded Leibniz rule.
	2.	Robin transmission operator

Fix alpha > 0 and positive symmetric edge weights beta_{ij} = beta_{ji} on nonempty overlaps U_{ij}. Define a degree +1 linear operator
R_{alpha,beta} : Tot^* -> Tot^{+1}
as follows. For q = 0 and psi = (psi_i)i in C^0(U; Omega^p),
(R{alpha,beta} psi)_{ij} := alpha(psi_i - psi_j) + beta_{ij} * L_X(psi_i + psi_j) in Omega^p(U_{ij}).
For q >= 1 extend R_{alpha,beta} uniquely as a graded derivation that commutes with restrictions; it preserves form degree and raises Cech degree by +1. Set D_R := D + R_{alpha,beta}.

Assumption 2.1 (J-compatibility). For Cech degree 0 incidence elements c (i.e. vertex scalars), R_{alpha,beta} commutes with J_c. Equivalently, beta is taken in a vertex-scaling gauge where the edge difference/sum extractors (defined next) commute with J_c on q = 0 and hence, by derivation, on all q.

Introduce q=0 linear operators E,S : C^0(U; Omega^p) -> C^1(U; Omega^p) by
E: (psi_i) |-> (psi_i - psi_j) on U_{ij},  S: (psi_i) |-> (psi_i + psi_j) on U_{ij},
and extend E,S as graded derivations to all q.
	3.	Basic identities

Cartan on Tot. Since delta_tot acts on Cech indices and iota_X on forms, [delta_tot, iota_X] = 0, hence [D, iota_X] = [d, iota_X] = L_X.

Commutation with contraction. R_{alpha,beta} has degree +1 and [iota_X, R_{alpha,beta}] = 0. Indeed [L_X, iota_X] = iota_{[X,X]} = 0 and the defining formula commutes with restrictions; the derivation extension preserves this.

Commutator with d. On q = 0,
[d, R_{alpha,beta}] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S],
where beta acts diagonally by (beta psi){ij} := beta{ij} psi. The identity extends by derivation to all q.

Curvature identity. Since D^2 = 0,
D_R^2 = 0  <=>  [D, R_{alpha,beta}] + R_{alpha,beta}^2 = 0.

Edge-wise form of curvature. Let p be the form degree of psi. For the component Tot^{p,0} -> Tot^{p,2} the condition D_R^2 = 0 is equivalent to the Robin cocycle equation
delta_tot( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi ) + R_{alpha,beta}( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi ) + [d, R_{alpha,beta}] psi = 0.
Using [d, R_{alpha,beta}] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S] yields an explicit q: 0 -> 2 formula.
	4.	Energy and urn selection

Geometric and analytic setup. Fix a Riemannian metric on M and a volume form. Let the cover U be subordinate to a partition of unity. Work in L^2- or Sobolev-based Banach scales where the operators below are bounded on each overlap. Assume either compact supports for the local fields or boundary conditions that kill boundary terms produced by integration by parts along X on U_{ij} (for example X tangent to the overlap boundaries, or standard cutoff).

Robin energy. For psi = (psi_i)i define
E{alpha,beta}(psi) := sum_{i<j} integral over U_{ij} [ alpha * ||psi_i - psi_j||^2 + beta_{ij} * || L_X(psi_i + psi_j) ||^2 ].

Euler–Lagrange equals Robin cocycle. Under the above boundary assumptions, the first variation of E_{alpha,beta} at psi in the direction of compactly supported variations yields the q: 0 -> 2 equation from Section 3. Hence the Euler–Lagrange equations are equivalent to the Robin cocycle equation.

Urn update and contraction. Consider the deterministic update
beta_{ij}^{(t+1)} = beta_{ij}^{(t)} + eta * ||psi_i^{(t)} - psi_j^{(t)}||{L^2(U{ij})}^2,  with 0 < eta < eta_0.
Assume convergence to beta^. Let (iota, pi, h) be the standard contraction data between (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot^*, D) given by a partition of unity. Work in a Banach norm where
gamma := ||h|| * ( alpha ||E|| + ||beta|| * ||S|| * ||L_X|| ) < 1.
Then the Neumann series used below converges.
	5.	DGLA and bracket calculus

Let g be the graded Lie subalgebra of End^(Tot^) generated by D_R, iota_X, L_X, and {J_a : a in I(N)}. With degrees |D_R|=+1, |iota_X|=-1, |L_X|=0, |J_a|=deg_Cech(a), the following relations hold:
[D_R, D_R] = 0,  [D_R, iota_X] = L_X,  [D_R, L_X] = 0,
[iota_X, iota_Y] = 0,  [L_X, iota_Y] = iota_[X,Y],  [L_X, L_Y] = L_[X,Y],
[J_a, J_b] = J_{[a,b]*},  [iota_X, J_a] = 0,  [L_X, J_a] = 0,
[D_R, J_a] = J{partial a}.
Here [a,b]* is the incidence convolution bracket and partial is the incidence derivation defined by [delta, J_a] = J{partial a}. The last line uses Assumption 2.1 and the derivation extensions.
	6.	Degree-0 factorization (BCH split)

Let g^0 be the degree-0 subalgebra and G^0 := exp(g^0). The Cech degree-0 incidence subalgebra generated by {J_c : |c| = 0} is commutative and, by Assumption 2.1, commutes with L_X. Hence
G^0 is isomorphic to exp< L_X > x exp< J_c (|c|=0) >,
and for Theta = sum_i lambda_i L_{X_i} + sum_j kappa_j J_{c_j},
exp(Theta) = exp( sum_i lambda_i L_{X_i} ) * exp( sum_j kappa_j J_{c_j} ).
	7.	Homological perturbation and cohomology invariance

Let (iota, pi, h) be a standard contraction (Omega^(M), d)  <=>  (Tot^, D). Under the contraction bound gamma < 1 in Section 4, the Neumann series
h_R := h * sum_{m >= 0} (- R_{alpha,beta^} h)^m
converges and provides a contraction
(Omega^(M), d)  ~=  (Tot^, D_R),
so H^(Tot, D_R) is canonically isomorphic to de Rham cohomology H^*_{dR}(M).
	8.	Global primitives and minimality

For any omega in Omega^k(M) there exist phi in Omega^{k-1}(M) and a D_R-closed h in Tot^{k-1} such that
iota_X(omega) = d phi + pi(h).
Construction: solve D_R eta = iota_X(omega) using the contraction from Section 7, then set phi := pi(eta) and h := eta - iota(phi). Under the energy setup of Section 4 the local solution space is affine and the Robin energy is strictly convex with parameters (alpha, beta^). Therefore phi is unique up to constants and minimizes E_{alpha,beta^} among local primitives.
	9.	Main theorem

Fix alpha > 0 and let beta^* satisfy the urn convergence and contraction bounds of Section 4. With R := R_{alpha,beta^} and D_R := D + R:
(1) Cartan preserved and curvature vanishing: D_R^2 = 0 and [D_R, iota_X] = L_X.
(2) DGLA relations: the generators {D_R, iota_X, L_X, J_a} satisfy the identities of Section 5.
(3) Degree-0 factorization: the BCH split of Section 6 holds.
(4) Cohomology invariance: H^(Tot, D_R) is naturally isomorphic to H^{dR}(M).
(5) Global primitive and minimality: for every omega there are phi and D_R-closed h with iota_X(omega) = d phi + pi(h), where phi minimizes E{alpha,beta^}.
Stability under urn updates. If beta’ is obtained by a vertex-scaling gauge change (degree-0 incidence action) and satisfies the same contraction bound, then D_{R’} is gauge-equivalent to D_R via exp< J_c (|c|=0) >, so the items above persist.
	10.	Consequences for constant-time templates

Assume:
(i) a fixed cover with bounded overlap number,
(ii) fixed truncation in form degree,
(iii) a finite band-limit for the L_X action on overlaps (finite tables for the required local Fourier or modal coefficients),
(iv) uniform bounds on ||X|| and the operator norms of E,S, and
(v) precomputed contraction data (iota, pi, h) and BCH tables for degree 0.
