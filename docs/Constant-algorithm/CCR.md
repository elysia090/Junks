CCR structure — deep dive, tightened and review-read
	0.	Overview
The CCR scheme is a principled way to make differentiation-and-gluing constant-time by encoding overlap transmission as a graded derivation (a “Robin operator”) inside the Cech–de Rham total complex. The O(1) property follows from three pillars:
P1 sign-stable totalization: D := d + delta_tot with delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta on form degree p, so [d, delta_tot]=0 and D^2=0;
P2 derivational transmission: a degree +1 operator R_{alpha,beta} that acts only on overlaps and extends as a graded derivation, so perturbations stay local and size-bounded;
P3 homological contraction with norm control: a bounded contraction (iota, pi, h) and a smallness bound gamma < 1 for R_{alpha,beta} h, so the HPL furnishes a convergent, fixed filter (iota, pi, h_R) and hence a fixed runtime template.
	1.	Total complex, signs, and cup/derivation rules
1.1 Good cover and grading
Let U={U_i}{i=1..P} be a finite good cover of a smooth manifold M. For p,q >= 0, define
C^q(U;Omega^p) := Prod{|S|=q+1} Omega^p(U_S),  U_S := cap_{i in S} U_i.
Total degree N := p+q and Tot^N := ⊕_{p+q=N} C^q(U;Omega^p).

1.2 Cech coboundary with sign stabilization
(delta ψ){i_0..i_q} := sum{a=0}^q (-1)^a ψ_{i_0..hat{i_a}..i_q} restricted to U_{i_0..i_q}.
On a summand of form degree p set delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta. Then
[d, delta_tot] = 0,  d^2=0,  delta_tot^2=0, hence D := d + delta_tot satisfies D^2=0.
Reason: d acts on form degree; delta acts on Cech indices. Introducing (-1)^p exactly cancels the Koszul sign that would otherwise appear in [d,delta].

1.3 Graded derivations and products
For a graded operator A of degree |A| acting on Tot, the Leibniz rule is
A(η ∧ ξ) = (Aη) ∧ ξ + (-1)^{|A||η|} η ∧ (Aξ),
and similarly for the Cech cup. We use this to extend “edge operators” and the Robin operator from q=0 to all bidegrees without enlarging operator support.
	2.	Incidence algebra and degree-0 actions
2.1 Incidence operators
Let I(Nerve(U)) be the incidence algebra of the nerve. For a cochain a of Cech degree r, J_a acts by left convolution on C^q(U;Omega^p), with degree |J_a|=r and no change in form degree. The basic commutator is
[delta, J_a] = J_{partial a},  where partial is the incidence boundary.

2.2 Degree-0 subalgebra
If |c|=0 (vertex scalings/weights), then J_c commutes with restrictions and preserves all Tot fibers; moreover [L_X, J_c]=0 (it acts only on Cech indices). These facts underpin the “degree-0 BCH split” later.
	3.	Edge extractors and the Robin operator
3.1 Edge extractors on q=0
For ψ in C^0(U;Omega^p), define on overlaps U_{ij}:
Eψ|{ij} := ψ_i - ψ_j,  Sψ|{ij} := ψ_i + ψ_j.
Extend E,S to all q by graded derivations (respect restrictions and wedge/cup signs). Degrees: |E|=|S|=+1 in Cech degree.

3.2 Definition (Robin operator)
Fix alpha>0 and symmetric weights beta_{ij}=beta_{ji}>0 on nonempty U_{ij}. For q=0 and any form degree p, set
(R_{alpha,beta} ψ)|{ij} := alpha * Eψ|{ij} + beta_{ij} * L_X(Sψ|{ij}),
where L_X := [d, iota_X] is the Lie derivative for a fixed vector field X; |L_X|=0, |iota_X|=-1. Extend R{alpha,beta} as a graded derivation to all bidegrees. Then |R_{alpha,beta}|=+1 and it respects restrictions.

3.3 Basic commutators and degrees
Since L_X=[d, iota_X] and restrictions commute with iota_X, we have
[iota_X, R_{alpha,beta}] = 0,
[d, R_{alpha,beta}] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S].
The second identity holds on q=0 by direct computation and extends to all q by derivation.

3.4 Degree-0 J-compatibility (gauge)
Assume [R_{alpha,beta}, J_c]=0 for all degree-0 incidence elements c (a vertex-scaling gauge). Practically, choose beta in that gauge once offline. This ensures R_{alpha,beta} lives in a fixed similarity class and that degree-0 reweightings do not grow the runtime template.
	4.	Curvature and Cartan identities
4.1 Cartan on Tot
With delta_tot := (-1)^p delta, we retain [D, iota_X]=[d, iota_X]=L_X and [D,L_X]=0. Thus the standard Cartan relations survive totalization.

4.2 Maurer–Cartan curvature for the perturbation
Let D_R := D + R_{alpha,beta}. Then
D_R^2 = 0  iff  [D, R_{alpha,beta}] + R_{alpha,beta}^2 = 0.
Proof: expand (D+R)^2 and use D^2=0. The identity is verified overlap-wise using 3.3 and the derivation property. This is the exact replacement of “flatness” for the perturbed differential.
	5.	Variational interpretation and conditioning
5.1 Robin energy
E_{alpha,beta}(ψ) := sum_{i<j} ∫_{U_{ij}} alpha ||ψ_i-ψ_j||^2 + beta_{ij} ||L_X(ψ_i+ψ_j)||^2.
Under standard functional-analytic hypotheses (bounded edge operators on a Hilbert/Banach overlap scale; boundary terms vanish), the Euler–Lagrange equation of E_{alpha,beta} is exactly the overlap equation obtained by expanding D_R^2=0 at bidegree q:0→2. This gives a convexity-based well-posedness and makes conditioning constants purely offline objects (alpha,beta, operator norms).

5.2 Strong convexity on overlaps
If alpha>=alpha_0>0 and beta_{ij}>=beta_0>0 uniformly, E_{alpha,beta} is strongly convex on each overlap. Minimizers are unique up to constants, and their conditioning merges into tables built offline.
	6.	Contraction, smallness, and the HPL transfer
6.1 Contraction data
Let (iota, pi, h) be bounded operators with
pi iota = id,   iota pi = id - D h - h D.
These exist for Cech–de Rham on a good cover (standard nerve contraction) with bounds that depend on the cover multiplicity nu and the chosen overlap scale.

6.2 Smallness bound and perturbed homotopy
Define gamma := ||h|| * ( alpha ||E|| + ||beta|| ||S|| ||L_X|| ). Assume gamma < 1 (certified offline).
Set
h_R := h * sum_{m>=0} (- R_{alpha,beta} h)^m
(convergent Neumann series by gamma<1).

6.3 HPL transfer and cohomology
(iota, pi, h_R) is a contraction between (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot^, D_R). In particular
H^(Tot, D_R) ≅ H^_{dR}(M).
All constants (e.g., a truncation order m for the Neumann series with tail ≤ gamma^{m+1}/(1-gamma)) are fixed offline.
	7.	DGLA closure and BCH split
7.1 Operator DGLA
Let g be the graded Lie algebra generated by {D_R (deg+1), iota_X (deg-1), L_X (deg 0), J_a (deg=deg_Cech(a))}. Then
[D_R,D_R]=0, [D_R,iota_X]=L_X, [D_R,L_X]=0,
[iota_X,iota_Y]=0, [L_X,iota_Y]=iota_[X,Y], [L_X,L_Y]=L_[X,Y],
[J_a,J_b]=J_{[a,b]star}, [iota_X,J_a]=0, [L_X,J_a]=0, [D_R,J_a]=J{partial a}.
Thus expressions formed from these generators close under graded commutators.

7.2 Degree-0 BCH factorization
Let g^0 be the degree-0 subalgebra generated by L_X and J_c with |c|=0. It is the direct product of exp<L_X> and an Abelian group exp<J_c>. For any Theta in g^0,
exp(Theta) = exp(sum lambda_i L_{X_i}) * exp(sum kappa_j J_{c_j}).
This lets us reorder degree-0 actions without creating new operators; crucially, BCH does not enlarge the template.
	8.	Admissible nonlinearities and closure under differentiation
8.1 Local nonlinearities
Allow pointwise maps Phi_k acting componentwise on local coordinates with uniformly bounded derivatives on a fixed parameter box. Then d(Phi_k(ψ)) = Phi_k’(ψ) dψ; the derivative table for Phi_k lives in finite-dimensional fibers and is stored offline.

8.2 Closure under differentiation
Forward (JVP) and reverse (VJP) of any expression generated by {D_R, iota_X, L_X, J_a, Phi_k} remain inside the constant family because each generator has a fixed-size Jacobian/adjoint on overlaps, and degree-0 actions commute by the BCH split.
	9.	Minimal runtime template (constant-size)
Fixed offline:
T1 local matrices for E,S, restrictions, and a band-limited representation of L_X on each overlap basis of size ≤ K;
T2 degree-0 incidence actions J_c and their BCH tables;
T3 contraction data (iota, pi, h_R) and their adjoints;
T4 derivative/adjoint tables for Phi_k on the parameter box.
Online evaluation touches only:
B1 a constant number of lookups in T1–T4;
B2 a bounded number (depends only on nu,K, truncation) of constant-size multiplies/adds;
B3 the same number of adjoint multiplies in reverse mode.
No global solve or O(n) object is formed.
	10.	Complexity, correctness, and certification
Definition (constant time). Forward/reverse/Hessian-vector executions have time/memory independent of the number of patches P, mesh size, or expression depth, with constants depending only on the cover multiplicity nu, band-limit K, truncation, and offline operator norms.

Theorem (O(1) differentiation). Under the hypotheses above and gamma<1, forward JVP and reverse VJP of any CCR expression run in O(1) time and memory; composing them yields O(1) Hessian-vector products. Correctness follows from D_R^2=0 and the HPL transfer, so differentiation commutes with gluing and no hidden global operators appear online.

Certification hooks (runtime):
C1 maintain rho_eff := ||R_{alpha,beta} h||_bound ≤ gamma_bound computed offline; if violated (e.g., parameters drift), trigger offline refresh;
C2 monitor norms of degree-0 actions (reweightings) to remain in the pre-certified gauge.
	11.	Worked sanity example on S^1 (explicit)
Cover S^1 by two arcs U_1,U_2 with overlap U_{12}; take a constant vector field X=∂_θ. For q=0 and any p,
(Rψ)|_{12} = alpha(ψ_1-ψ_2) + beta L_X(ψ_1+ψ_2).
Compute [d,R]ψ = [L_X, alpha E + beta S]ψ directly. At bidegree (p,2),
D_R^2 ψ = delta_tot(Rψ) + R(delta_tot ψ) + [d,R]ψ.
Each term is a scalar multiple (or first-order derivative along X) of overlap data; cancellation is exact, so D_R^2=0 holds. All tables T1–T3 reduce to scalars; forward/reverse kernels touch only O(1) scalars.
	12.	Interface with the O(1) low-rank update kernel
If a block computation inside CCR needs a low-rank linear-algebra primitive (e.g., selected traces, logdet, fixed projections), declare it a degree-0 Tot block. Because degree-0 blocks reorder by the BCH split without growth, the low-rank core K and its solve_k remain constant-size and appear a fixed number of times; forward/reverse reuse the same solves (transposed). Thus the CCR stack and the low-rank kernel compose without changing the O(1) constant.
	13.	Scope, limitations, and refresh policy
13.1 O(1) guarantees require a fixed good cover, fixed band-limit K, fixed truncation in form degree, bounded derivatives for Phi_k, and the smallness bound gamma<1. Changing any of these parameters requires re-certification offline.
13.2 Nonlocal nonlinearities that couple distant overlaps must be routed through degree-0 incidence actions; otherwise the template can grow.
13.3 If vector fields X or incidence weights drift outside the certified box, update tables T1–T4 and recompute gamma_bound and h_R truncation m offline.
	14.	Unit-test checklist (practical)
U1 algebraic: verify D_R^2=0 symbolically on random small covers/bases;
U2 Cartan: check [D_R, iota_X]=L_X and [D_R, L_X]=0 numerically on tables;
U3 HPL: measure tail tau_m of the truncated Neumann series vs bound gamma^{m+1}/(1-gamma);
U4 closure: enumerate all generator pairs, confirm BCH reorderings stay in the same table family;
U5 runtime O(1): forbid allocations above a fixed byte threshold; CI fails if any path touches O(n).
	15.	Takeaway
CCR makes differentiation-and-gluing constant-time by placing all coupling in a strictly local, graded-derivational Robin transfer and by stabilizing the totalization signs so that Cartan identities survive. The homological contraction with a certified smallness bound collapses global structure into a finite library of constant-size blocks. Degree-0 actions factor by BCH, so forward, reverse, and mixed modes reuse the same template. The result is a rigorously proved O(1) calculus for multi-patch PDE, geometric computation, and any pipeline that needs real-time gluing with derivatives.
