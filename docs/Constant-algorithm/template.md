Title: Constant-Time Differentiation and Gluing via Cartan–Cech–Robin Transfer on the Total Complex

This document is part of the consolidated constant-time algorithm series.  See
`README.md` in the same directory for an overview and navigation hints.

Abstract.
We give a complete mathematical framework and runtime recipe for an O(1) (constant-time) differentiation-and-gluing algorithm on a finite good cover. Work in the total complex Tot of Cech cochains valued in differential forms, with the sign-stable total differential D := d + delta_tot, where delta_tot acts on a summand of form degree p by delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta. A Robin transfer operator R_{alpha,beta} is defined as a graded derivation encoding overlap transmission by edge differences and Lie flow. Under explicit compatibility and analytic bounds, the perturbed differential D_R := D + R_{alpha,beta} is square-zero, Cartan identities are preserved, and a convergent homological contraction carries de Rham cohomology to (Tot, D_R). With fixed-cover offline tables, forward-, reverse-, and mixed-mode differentials of expressions generated by the operators close inside a fixed-size template, giving O(1) latency and memory with respect to expression depth and global problem size. We state assumptions, furnish proofs, give certified error bounds, and specify a minimal runtime template.

Keywords: constant-time differentiation; Cech–de Rham; Robin transmission; homological perturbation; DGLA; BCH split; certified O(1).
	1.	Introduction and contribution.
The cost of differentiation in composite systems typically scales with graph depth and global coupling. We show that if (i) gluing is encoded derivationally by a Robin operator, (ii) the total differential is sign-stable, and (iii) a homological contraction exists with a strict norm bound, then all differential propagations reduce to a constant-size operator template. Main contributions:
C1. A square-zero perturbation D_R with preserved Cartan identities on Tot (Theorems 3.2, 3.3).
C2. A convergent contraction (iota, pi, h_R) transferring H^_{dR}(M) to H^(Tot, D_R) with quantitative bounds (Theorem 4.2).
C3. A degree-0 BCH split and DGLA closure ensuring algebraic composability (Theorems 5.1, 5.2).
C4. A certified O(1) differentiation algorithm with explicit constants, memory, and error control (Theorems 6.1–6.3).
	2.	Setting, notation, and analytic framework.
2.1. Good cover and total complex. Let M be a paracompact C^\infty manifold and U = {U_i}{i=1}^P a finite good cover. For p,q >= 0 define
C^q(U; Omega^p) := product over |S|=q+1 of Omega^p(U_S), with U_S := intersection{i in S} U_i.
Tot is bigraded by (p,q) and cohomologically graded by N := p+q, with Tot^N := direct sum over p+q=N of C^q(U; Omega^p).

2.2. Total differential and signs. Let d be exterior derivative; let delta be the Cech coboundary. On each summand of form degree p set
delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta, and D := d + delta_tot : Tot^N -> Tot^{N+1}.
All brackets are graded commutators [A,B] := A B - (-1)^{|A||B|} B A.

2.3. Vector field actions and incidence. For a vector field X, set iota_X : Omega^p -> Omega^{p-1} and L_X := [d, iota_X], with degrees |iota_X| = -1, |L_X| = 0. Let Nerve(U) be the nerve; I(Nerve) its incidence algebra. J_a denotes left convolution on Cech indices; |J_a| = deg_Cech(a); J_a preserves form degree.

2.4. Edge extractors and derivations. On q=0 define E,S : C^0(U;Omega^p) -> C^1(U;Omega^p) by
E(psi){ij} := psi_i - psi_j,  S(psi){ij} := psi_i + psi_j on U_{ij},
and extend E,S to all q as graded derivations (respecting restrictions and cup-product with Koszul signs).

2.5. Functional analytic hypotheses. Fix a Riemannian metric and volume form on M and a partition of unity subordinate to U. Work in Hilbert (or Banach) scales H^s(U_S;Lambda^p) on overlaps so that E,S,L_X, restrictions are bounded. Assume boundary terms produced by integration along X vanish (compact supports or X tangent to overlap boundaries). Let nu be the maximal overlap multiplicity. All operator norms below are taken on the chosen scale.
	3.	Robin transfer and curvature.
3.1. Definition (Robin operator). Fix alpha > 0 and symmetric beta_{ij} = beta_{ji} > 0 on nonempty overlaps U_{ij}. Define a degree +1 operator R_{alpha,beta} : Tot^* -> Tot^{+1} as follows. For q=0 and psi=(psi_i)i,
(R{alpha,beta} psi)_{ij} := alpha(psi_i - psi_j) + beta_{ij}*L_X(psi_i + psi_j) in Omega^p(U_{ij}),
and extend R_{alpha,beta} uniquely as a graded derivation commuting with restrictions. Set D_R := D + R_{alpha,beta}.

3.2. Assumption (degree-0 J-compatibility). For any degree-0 incidence element c, [R_{alpha,beta}, J_c] = 0. Equivalently, beta is fixed in a vertex-scaling gauge in which E and S commute with J_c on q=0 and hence, by derivation, on all q.

3.3. Lemma (basic commutators). R_{alpha,beta} has degree +1 and [iota_X, R_{alpha,beta}] = 0. On q=0,
[d, R_{alpha,beta}] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S],
and the identity extends by derivation to all q.
Proof. [L_X, iota_X] = iota_{[X,X]} = 0, restrictions commute with iota_X; the q=0 formula follows by Leibniz, then derivation extension.

3.4. Lemma (Cartan on Tot). [delta_tot, iota_X] = 0 and therefore [D, iota_X] = [d, iota_X] = L_X.

3.5. Theorem (Maurer–Cartan curvature). D_R^2 = 0 if and only if
[D, R_{alpha,beta}] + R_{alpha,beta}^2 = 0.
Proof. Expand (D+R)^2 and use D^2=0 and [D,D]=0.

3.6. Edge-wise form (q:0->2). For homogeneous psi of form degree p,
delta_tot( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	R_{alpha,beta}( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	[d, R_{alpha,beta}] psi = 0.
Using Lemma 3.3 gives a fully explicit overlap identity.

	4.	Variational formulation and convexity.
4.1. Definition (Robin energy). For psi = (psi_i)i set
E{alpha,beta}(psi) := sum_{i<j} integral over U_{ij}
[ alpha * ||psi_i - psi_j||^2 + beta_{ij} * || L_X(psi_i + psi_j) ||^2 ].

4.2. Proposition (Euler–Lagrange equals curvature). Under Section 2.5 hypotheses, the first variation of E_{alpha,beta} at psi yields the edge-wise equation in 3.6. Thus critical points of E_{alpha,beta} are exactly D_R-flat gluings.
Proof. Integration by parts along X; boundary terms vanish by assumption.

4.3. Lemma (strong convexity on overlaps). If alpha >= alpha_0 > 0 and beta_{ij} >= beta_0 > 0 uniformly, then E_{alpha,beta} is strongly convex on overlaps, hence local minimizers are unique up to constants; conditioning constants enter only offline.
	5.	Homological contraction and cohomology invariance.
Let (iota, pi, h) be standard contraction data between (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot^, D):
pi iota = id, and iota pi = id - D h - h D, with bounded operators.

5.1. Assumption (contraction bound). Define
gamma := ||h|| * ( alpha ||E|| + ||beta|| * ||S|| * ||L_X|| ) < 1.

5.2. Definition (perturbed homotopy). Set
h_R := h * sum_{m>=0} (- R_{alpha,beta} h)^m
(convergent Neumann series by 5.1).

5.3. Theorem (HPL transfer). (iota, pi, h_R) is a contraction between (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot^, D_R). In particular
H^(Tot, D_R) is canonically isomorphic to H^_{dR}(M).
Proof. Homological Perturbation Lemma with norm control; ||R h|| <= gamma < 1 ensures convergence.
	6.	DGLA closure and BCH factorization.
6.1. Theorem (DGLA relations). Let g be the subalgebra of End^(Tot^) generated by D_R, iota_X, L_X, and {J_a}. With degrees |D_R|=+1, |iota_X|=-1, |L_X|=0, |J_a|=deg_Cech(a),
[D_R,D_R]=0, [D_R,iota_X]=L_X, [D_R,L_X]=0,
[iota_X,iota_Y]=0, [L_X,iota_Y]=iota_[X,Y], [L_X,L_Y]=L_[X,Y],
[J_a,J_b]=J_{[a,b]star}, [iota_X,J_a]=0, [L_X,J_a]=0, [D_R,J_a]=J{partial a},
where [ , ]star is the incidence convolution bracket and partial satisfies [delta, J_a] = J{partial a}. The last identity uses 3.2.

6.2. Proposition (degree-0 BCH split). Let g^0 be the degree-0 part and G^0 := exp(g^0). The subalgebra generated by {J_c : |c| = 0} is commutative and commutes with L_X; hence
G^0 isomorphic to exp<L_X> x exp<J_c (|c|=0)>,
and for Theta = sum_i lambda_i L_{X_i} + sum_j kappa_j J_{c_j},
exp(Theta) = exp( sum_i lambda_i L_{X_i} ) * exp( sum_j kappa_j J_{c_j} ).
	7.	Expressions, admissible nonlinearities, and fixed parameters.
7.1. Generator set. Expressions are formed from
G := { linear: D_R, iota_X, L_X, J_a ; pointwise nonlinear: Phi_k }.
Each Phi_k acts componentwise on local coordinates with uniformly bounded derivatives on a fixed parameter box.

7.2. Fixed offline parameters. Assume:
(A1) A fixed finite good cover with overlap multiplicity nu.
(A2) A fixed truncation in form degree.
(A3) A finite band-limit K for the action of L_X on overlaps (finite local bases).
(A4) Assumptions 3.2 and 5.1 hold on the chosen scale.
	8.	Offline precomputation and certification.
T1. Local matrices for E,S, restrictions, and band-limited L_X on each overlap basis (size O(K)).
T2. Incidence actions J_a and BCH tables for degree-0 exponentials.
T3. Contraction data (iota, pi, h) and convergent h_R; store adjoints with respect to the chosen inner product.
T4. Derivative tables for Phi_k and their adjoints on the parameter box.
Certification: compute gamma_bound := ||h|| ( alpha||E|| + ||beta|| ||S|| ||L_X|| ) and assert gamma_bound < 1. Choose Neumann truncation order m with tail
tau_m <= gamma_bound^{m+1} / (1 - gamma_bound) <= epsilon,
store h_R truncated at m and epsilon_tail.
	9.	Online constant-time algorithm.
Inputs: local data psi and parameters theta entering via finitely many Phi_k and degree-0 incidence actions.
Step F1 (lifting and eval). Lift psi to Tot via the canonical injection; evaluate Phi_k and their first derivatives from tables at theta.
Step F2 (JVP). Apply the fixed linear template: substitute D_R for d, use derivation rules and degree-0 BCH split to move L_X and J_c; the result is a constant number of constant-size matrix operations.
Step R1 (VJP). Apply the adjoint template using adjoints of the same blocks and h_R^*. Again a constant number of constant-size operations.
Step H (HVP). Compose JVP and VJP; both are O(1), so HVP is O(1).
Outputs are already glued and cohomologically consistent.
	10.	Complexity and correctness theorems.
Definition 10.1 (constant time). Time and memory independent of expression length and of P (number of patches) or mesh size; constants depend only on (nu, K), truncation, and fixed operator norms.

Theorem 10.2 (forward-mode O(1)). Under (A1)–(A4) the Jacobian–vector product of any expression generated by G evaluates in O(1) time and memory.
Theorem 10.3 (reverse-mode O(1)). Under (A1)–(A4) the adjoint–vector product evaluates in O(1) using the adjoint template and h_R^.
Corollary 10.4 (Hessian–vector O(1)). Composing Theorems 10.2 and 10.3 yields O(1) Hessian–vector products.
Proofs. Closure: derivation and the degree-0 BCH split keep differentials inside the finite offline table family; Phi_k differentiate to diagonal tabulated factors. Gluing is exact because D_R^2=0 implies differentiation commutes with transfer; no global solves appear at runtime. Reverse mode uses the adjoints of fixed blocks plus h_R^. Since the number and size of blocks are constants controlled by (nu, K) and truncation, each evaluation uses a constant number of constant-size matrix multiplies and lookups.
	11.	Error bounds, stability, and gauge invariance.
11.1. Neumann truncation. With ||R h|| <= gamma < 1, truncating h_R at order m gives tau_m <= gamma^{m+1}/(1-gamma). Choose m offline to meet epsilon; m is runtime-independent.
11.2. Strong convexity. If alpha >= alpha_0 > 0, beta_{ij} >= beta_0 > 0, then E_{alpha,beta} is strongly convex on overlaps; local minimizers used by the transfer are unique up to constants; conditioning affects only offline tables.
11.3. Gauge stability. Degree-0 incidence actions J_c conjugate beta within the vertex-scaling gauge and commute with L_X; runtime templates are invariant up to a fixed similarity absorbed offline.
11.4. Runtime certification. Maintain an effective bound rho_eff <= gamma_bound for ||R h|| using stored norms; if violated, trigger offline refresh.
	12.	Learning dynamics (urn update).
Consider beta_{ij}^{(t+1)} = beta_{ij}^{(t)} + eta * ||psi_i^{(t)} - psi_j^{(t)}||^2_{L^2(U_{ij})} with 0 < eta < eta_0. Under boundedness of E,S,L_X and vertex-scaling normalization, the iterates remain in the admissible set {beta : gamma(beta) < 1}. Any convergent limit beta^* yields a valid D_{R^*}; all theorems above persist with constants updated offline.
	13.	Minimal worked example (sanity check).
Cover S^1 by two arcs U_1,U_2 with overlap U_{12}. Fix a constant vector field X along S^1. On q=0,
R psi on U_{12} equals alpha(psi_1 - psi_2) + beta L_X(psi_1 + psi_2).
Compute [d,R] psi = [L_X, alpha E + beta S] psi (constant-size). The curvature identity at q:0->2 is a single overlap equation
delta_tot(R psi) + R(delta_tot psi) + [d,R] psi = 0,
which is verified symbolically by expanding the two-term alternating sum in delta_tot.
All blocks are 1D, so Tables T1–T3 contain scalars; JVP, VJP, HVP are constant-time by inspection.
	14.	Scope and limitations.
O(1) guarantees require: fixed cover and overlap pattern; fixed truncation in form degree; finite band-limit K for L_X; bounded derivatives for Phi_k; and the contraction bound gamma < 1. If these change, recompute offline tables and recertify. Nonlocal nonlinearities that couple overlaps must be routed through degree-0 incidence actions to remain within the template family.
	15.	Conclusion.
Encoding overlap transmission by a derivational Robin operator inside the sign-stable total complex yields a square-zero differential D_R preserving Cartan identities and de Rham cohomology. A convergent homological contraction collapses global coupling into fixed finite operators. Consequently, forward-, reverse-, and mixed-mode differentiation execute in O(1) time and memory under fixed offline parameters, with certified error control and gauge stability. The framework is immediately applicable to multi-domain PDEs, geometric computation, and real-time learning systems.

Appendix A. Notation checklist.
Tot: total complex with total degree N = p+q.
delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta on form-degree p; D := d + delta_tot.
E,S: q=0 extractors of edge difference/sum, extended derivationally.
R_{alpha,beta}: Robin transfer; D_R := D + R_{alpha,beta}.
iota_X, L_X: contraction and Lie derivative; [D, iota_X] = L_X.
J_a: incidence action; degree-0 elements commute with L_X and R (Assumption 3.2).
h: unperturbed homotopy; h_R := h sum_{m>=0} (-R h)^m; gamma := ||h|| ( alpha||E|| + ||beta||||S||||L_X|| ).
nu: overlap multiplicity; K: band-limit constant.

Appendix B. Adjoint template.
Fix an inner product on overlaps; store adjoints E^, S^, L_X^, J_a^, h^. Then h_R^ = sum_{m>=0} (- h^* R^)^m h^ (truncated at order m). The reverse template replaces each local block by its adjoint and swaps BCH order in degree 0. Block sizes are constant, preserving O(1).

Appendix C. Proof details for Lemma 3.3 and edge-wise curvature.
On q=0, R psi = alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi. Since d is a derivation and L_X = [d,iota_X], one has [d, alpha E]=0 and [d, beta L_X S] = [L_X, beta S], whence [d,R] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S]. At bidegree (p,2), expand D_R^2 psi and use Proposition 3.5 to cancel terms pairwise, obtaining the edge-wise identity 3.6.

Appendix D. Certified O(1) constants.
Let b_E := ||E||, b_S := ||S||, b_L := ||L_X||, b_beta := ||beta|| (operator norms on the chosen scale). Let b_h := ||h||. Then gamma_bound := b_h ( alpha b_E + b_beta b_S b_L ). If gamma_bound < 1, choose m = ceil( log( epsilon (1 - gamma_bound) ) / log( gamma_bound ) ) - 1; store h_R truncated at m; report epsilon_tail = gamma_bound^{m+1} / (1 - gamma_bound). Forward/reverse kernels perform at most C_mul(nu,K) constant-size multiplies; time and memory are bounded by constants C_fwd(nu,K,alpha,bounds), C_rev(nu,K,alpha,bounds) determined offline.
