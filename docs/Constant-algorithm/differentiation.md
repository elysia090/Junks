Abstract.
We give a constant-time (O(1)) differentiation algorithm for patchwise differential data over a finite good cover. The construction works in the total complex Tot built from Cech cochains with differential forms. A sign-stable total differential D := d + delta_tot is fixed by setting delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta on the summand of form degree p. A Robin transfer operator R_{alpha,beta} acts derivationally on Cech indices and encodes overlap transmission by differences and Lie flow. Under explicit compatibility and analytic bounds, D_R := D + R_{alpha,beta} is a square-zero differential (D_R^2 = 0), Cartan relations are preserved, and a convergent homological contraction transfers de Rham cohomology to (Tot, D_R). With precomputed finite tables (overlap operators, Lie actions, incidence actions, contraction data), forward-, reverse-, and mixed-mode derivatives of expressions generated by these operators evaluate in O(1) time and memory with respect to expression length and problem scale. The method yields a topology-preserving, structure-stable differentiation layer for PDE coupling, geometric computation, and real-time pipelines.

	1.	Introduction.
Differentiation in composite systems typically scales with graph depth and global coupling. We show that, for data given on a fixed finite good cover, one can encode gluing by a derivational Robin operator R_{alpha,beta} and work in a total complex Tot where (i) the total differential is sign-stable, (ii) the perturbation preserves square-zero and Cartan identities, and (iii) a homological contraction exists. Under these conditions, all derivative propagation (forward, reverse, and mixed) closes in a fixed-size template independent of expression length and mesh size, enabling O(1) differentiation after offline precomputation.
	2.	Preliminaries and notation.
2.1. Good cover and Cech cochains. Let M be a paracompact C^\infty manifold, U = {U_i}{i=1}^P a finite good cover. For p,q >= 0 put
C^q(U; Omega^p) := product over |S|=q+1 of Omega^p(U_S), where U_S := intersection{i in S} U_i.
Define Tot^N := direct sum over p+q=N of C^q(U; Omega^p).

2.2. Total differential and signs. Let d be the exterior derivative on forms and delta the Cech coboundary. On a summand of form degree p we set
delta_tot := (-1)^p * delta,  D := d + delta_tot : Tot^N -> Tot^{N+1}.
Brackets are graded commutators [A,B] := A B - (-1)^{|A||B|} B A, with |A| the induced cohomological degree shift.

2.3. Vector field actions and incidence. For a vector field X, iota_X : Omega^p -> Omega^{p-1} is contraction and L_X := [d, iota_X] is the Lie derivative (|iota_X|=-1, |L_X|=0). Let Nerve(U) be the nerve and I(Nerve) its incidence algebra; J_a denotes left convolution, |J_a|=deg_Cech(a), preserving form degree. On q=0 define E,S : C^0(U;Omega^p)->C^1(U;Omega^p) by
E(psi){ij} := psi_i - psi_j,  S(psi){ij} := psi_i + psi_j,
and extend both derivationally in the Cech degree.
	3.	Robin transfer operator.
Definition 3.1 (Robin operator). Fix alpha > 0 and symmetric weights beta_{ij}=beta_{ji}>0 for nonempty overlaps U_{ij}. Define a degree +1 operator R_{alpha,beta} : Tot^* -> Tot^{+1} by, for q=0 and psi=(psi_i)i,
(R{alpha,beta} psi)_{ij} := alpha(psi_i - psi_j) + beta_{ij}*L_X(psi_i + psi_j) in Omega^p(U_{ij}),
and extend R_{alpha,beta} uniquely as a graded derivation commuting with restrictions. Set D_R := D + R_{alpha,beta}.

Assumption A (degree-0 J-compatibility). For Cech degree 0 incidence elements c, [R_{alpha,beta}, J_c] = 0. Equivalently, beta is fixed in a vertex-scaling gauge in which E and S commute with J_c on q=0 and, by derivation, on all q.

Lemma 3.2 (basic commutators). R_{alpha,beta} has degree +1 and [iota_X, R_{alpha,beta}] = 0. On q=0,
[d, R_{alpha,beta}] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S],
and this identity extends by derivation to all q.
	4.	Curvature and Cartan identities.
Lemma 4.1 (Cartan on Tot). [delta_tot, iota_X] = 0 and therefore [D, iota_X] = [d, iota_X] = L_X.

Proposition 4.2 (Maurer–Cartan form). D_R^2 = 0 iff
[D, R_{alpha,beta}] + R_{alpha,beta}^2 = 0.
Edge-wise form. On Tot^{p,0} -> Tot^{p,2}, for homogeneous psi,
delta_tot( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	R_{alpha,beta}( alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi )
	•	[d, R_{alpha,beta}] psi = 0.
Using Lemma 3.2 yields an explicit overlap-level identity.

	5.	Energetic formulation.
Analytic setup. Fix a Riemannian metric and volume form. Assume either compact supports for local fields or boundary conditions that kill boundary terms produced by integration by parts along X on U_{ij}. Work in a Hilbert scale H^s of differential forms in which the operators below are bounded.

Definition 5.1 (Robin energy). For psi = (psi_i)i define
E{alpha,beta}(psi) := sum_{i<j} integral over U_{ij}
[ alpha * ||psi_i - psi_j||^2 + beta_{ij} * || L_X(psi_i + psi_j) ||^2 ].

Proposition 5.2 (Euler–Lagrange equals curvature). Under the boundary assumptions, the first variation of E_{alpha,beta} at psi yields the edge-wise Maurer–Cartan equation of Proposition 4.2. Hence critical points of E_{alpha,beta} are exactly D_R-flat glueings.
	6.	Homological contraction and cohomology invariance.
Let (iota, pi, h) be standard contraction data between (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot^, D), i.e.
pi iota = id,  iota pi = id - D h - h D,
with bounded operators on the chosen Hilbert scale.

Assumption B (contraction bound). In operator norm set
gamma := ||h|| * ( alpha ||E|| + ||beta|| * ||S|| * ||L_X|| ) < 1.

Define the Neumann series
h_R := h * sum_{m>=0} (- R_{alpha,beta} h)^m,
which converges by Assumption B.

Theorem 6.1 (HPL transfer). The data (iota, pi, h_R) provide a contraction
(Omega^(M), d) ~= (Tot^, D_R).
In particular H^(Tot, D_R) is canonically isomorphic to H^_{dR}(M).
	7.	DGLA relations and degree-0 factorization.
Let g be the subalgebra of End^(Tot^) generated by D_R, iota_X, L_X, and {J_a}.

Theorem 7.1 (DGLA). With degrees |D_R|=+1, |iota_X|=-1, |L_X|=0, |J_a|=deg_Cech(a),
[D_R,D_R]=0, [D_R,iota_X]=L_X, [D_R,L_X]=0,
[iota_X,iota_Y]=0, [L_X,iota_Y]=iota_[X,Y], [L_X,L_Y]=L_[X,Y],
[J_a,J_b]=J_{[a,b]star}, [iota_X,J_a]=0, [L_X,J_a]=0, [D_R,J_a]=J{partial a},
where [ , ]star is incidence convolution and partial satisfies [delta, J_a] = J{partial a}. The last identity uses Assumption A.

Proposition 7.2 (degree-0 BCH split). Let g^0 be the degree-0 part and G^0 := exp(g^0). The subalgebra generated by {J_c : |c|=0} is commutative and commutes with L_X, hence
G^0 isomorphic to exp<L_X> x exp<J_c (|c|=0)>,
and for Theta = sum_i lambda_i L_{X_i} + sum_j kappa_j J_{c_j},
exp(Theta) = exp( sum_i lambda_i L_{X_i} ) * exp( sum_j kappa_j J_{c_j} ).
	8.	Expressions, precomputation, and runtime model.
Expressions. Consider expressions built from the generator set
G := { linear: D_R, iota_X, L_X, J_a ; pointwise nonlinear: Phi_k }.
Pointwise nonlinearities Phi_k act componentwise with bounded derivatives.

Fixed offline parameters. Assume:
(A1) a fixed finite good cover with bounded overlap multiplicity nu;
(A2) a fixed truncation in form degree;
(A3) a finite band-limit K for the action of L_X on overlaps (finite local bases);
(A4) the bounds in Assumptions A and B hold.

Offline precomputation. Build constant-size tables:
(T1) local matrices for E,S, restrictions, and band-limited L_X on each overlap;
(T2) incidence operators J_a and BCH tables for degree 0;
(T3) contraction data (iota, pi, h) and the convergent h_R, and their adjoints;
(T4) derivative tables for Phi_k and their adjoints on the parameter ranges of interest.
	9.	Main results: constant-time differentiation.
Define “constant time” as time and memory independent of expression length (operator composition depth) and independent of the number of patches or mesh size, with constants depending only on (nu, K) and the operator norms fixed offline.

Theorem 9.1 (forward-mode O(1)). Under (A1)–(A4), the Jacobian–vector product of any expression generated by G evaluates by a fixed template of constant size. Online time and memory are O(1).

Theorem 9.2 (reverse-mode O(1)). Under (A1)–(A4), the adjoint–vector product evaluates by the adjoint template using the adjoints of the same fixed matrices and h_R^*. Online time and memory are O(1).

Corollary 9.3 (Hessian–vector O(1)). Composing Theorems 9.1 and 9.2 yields Hessian–vector products in O(1).

Proof sketch (common to 9.1–9.3). Closure: by derivation rules and the BCH split, the differential of any generator remains in the finite table family; Phi_k differentiate to diagonal (tabulated) factors. Gluing is exact: D_R^2=0 ensures that differentiation commutes with transfer and preserves the chain structure, so no global linear solves appear at runtime. Reverse mode is handled by adjoints of the fixed local blocks together with the precomputed h_R^*. Since the number and size of blocks are fixed by (nu, K) and truncation, each evaluation uses a constant number of constant-size matrix operations.
	10.	Stability, error bounds, and certification.
Neumann truncation. Truncating h_R at order m gives tail bound
|| (R_{alpha,beta} h)^{m+1} || / (1 - || R_{alpha,beta} h ||).
For fixed gamma < 1, choose m once so that the tail is below a prescribed epsilon; m is a runtime-independent constant.

Strong convexity. If alpha >= alpha_0 > 0 and beta_{ij} >= beta_0 > 0 uniformly, then the Robin energy is strongly convex on overlaps, giving uniqueness (up to constants) for local minimizers used in transfer. Conditioning enters only offline.

Gauge stability. Degree-0 incidence actions J_c conjugate beta within the vertex-scaling gauge and commute with L_X, so runtime templates remain invariant up to a similarity transform absorbed offline.

Certification. A lightweight runtime check monitors
rho_eff := || R_{alpha,beta} h ||,
and verifies rho_eff < 1 using the precomputed norm bounds; failure triggers re-precomputation.
	11.	Limitations and scope.
The O(1) guarantees require: fixed cover and overlap pattern; fixed truncation in form degree; a finite band-limit for L_X; bounded derivatives for Phi_k; the contraction bound gamma < 1. If these change, a new offline precomputation is required. Nonlocal nonlinearities that couple overlaps must be routed through degree-0 incidence actions to remain within the template family.
	12.	Implementation notes.
Data layout. Store per-overlap small dense blocks for E,S,L_X; sparse incidence for J_a; arrays for Phi_k and derivatives; precomputed (iota, pi, h) and h_R, plus adjoints. Numerics. Use stable factorizations for local blocks; normalize beta by vertex scaling (Assumption A); monitor gamma. Testing. Unit tests on q<=2 components of D_R^2 and on adjoint consistency; randomized property tests for [D_R, iota_X] = L_X. Integration. The runtime kernel is a sequence of constant-size matrix multiplies and table lookups; SIMD/GPU mapping is straightforward because overlap computations are independent.
	13.	Conclusion.
Encoding overlap transmission by a derivational Robin operator and working in the sign-stable total complex yields a structure-preserving differential D_R with square-zero curvature and exact Cartan identities. A convergent homological contraction transfers de Rham cohomology, and all differential propagations close in a fixed finite template. Consequently, forward-, reverse-, and mixed-mode differentiation execute in O(1) time and memory under fixed offline parameters. This provides a reproducible, topology-invariant differentiation layer suitable for multi-domain PDEs, geometric reasoning, and real-time systems.
