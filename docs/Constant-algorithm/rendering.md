Title: Constant-Time Rendering and Differentiation via Cartan–Cech–Robin Twisting on a Fixed Tile Cover

Abstract.
A single formalism is presented in which a derivational Robin operator R twists the Čech–de Rham total complex to a Maurer–Cartan (MC) flat differential D_R:=D+R, preserves Cartan identities, admits a degree-0 Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff (BCH) factorization, and supports a homological perturbation contraction with explicit norm control. Specializing to a fixed tile cover of the image plane yields a real-time rendering pipeline whose per-tile evaluation and first-/second-order derivatives are O(1) in time and memory, independent of the number of lights, primitives, or pixels. All constants are certified offline with quantitative error bounds.

	0.	Functional-analytic scale.
Fix a Sobolev level s≫0 on each nonempty overlap U_S. All operators below act between H^s(U_S;Λ^p) and H^{s−k}(U_S;Λ^{p±1}) as indicated. Norms ‖·‖ are operator norms at level s. Smallness inequalities are evaluated at level s so that R h is bounded.
	1.	Total complex and signs.
For p,q≥0 let C^q(U;Ω^p):=∏_{|S|=q+1}Ω^p(U_S). Set Tot^{p,q}:=C^q(U;Ω^p) and Tot^N:=⊕_{p+q=N}Tot^{p,q}. Define the sign-stable Čech lift δ_tot:=(-1)^p δ on Tot^{p,q} and D:=d+δ_tot on Tot^N. Then D^2=0 (bicomplex signs: d^2=0, δ^2=0, dδ_tot+δ_tot d=0). For a homogeneous endomorphism A of Tot, write |A| for its total-degree shift and [A,B]:=AB−(−1)^{|A||B|}BA.
	2.	Vector-field operators and incidence.
For a vector field X define ι_X:Ω^p→Ω^{p−1} and L_X:=[d,ι_X] with |ι_X|=−1, |L_X|=0. Since δ_tot acts on Čech indices and ι_X on forms, [δ_tot,ι_X]=0 and hence [D,ι_X]=L_X, [D,L_X]=0. Let N(U) be the nerve and I(N) its incidence algebra. For a∈I(N), let J_a be left convolution on Čech indices; |J_a| is the Čech degree of a. The incidence derivation ∂_inc is determined by [δ,J_a]=J_{∂_inc a}. Degree-0 incidence (vertex weights) is commutative.
	3.	Edge derivations and Robin transmission.
On q=0 define E,S:C^0→C^1 by (Eψ){ij}:=ψ_i−ψ_j and (Sψ){ij}:=ψ_i+ψ_j on U_{ij}. Each extends uniquely to a graded derivation of degree +1 that commutes with restrictions (total-degree Leibniz rule). Fix α>0 and symmetric β_{ij}>0 on nonempty U_{ij}. On q=0 set
(Rψ){ij}:=α(ψ_i−ψ_j)+β{ij} L_X(ψ_i+ψ_j),
and extend R as a degree +1 derivation commuting with restrictions. Put D_R:=D+R.

Assumption 3.1 (J-compatibility).
There exists a vertex scaling gauge for β such that [E,J_c]=[S,J_c]=[R,J_c]=0 for degree-0 incidence c; by derivation this holds on all Čech degrees.

Lemma 3.2 (basic commutators).
On q=0, [d,R]=[L_X,αE+βS] and [ι_X,R]=0; by derivation extension these identities hold on Tot. Consequently [D_R,ι_X]=L_X and [D_R,L_X]=0.
	4.	Maurer–Cartan flatness and BCH.
The following are equivalent:
(i) D_R^2=0.
(ii) [D,R]+R^2=0.
(iii) ∂R+(1/2)[R,R]=0 where ∂:=ad_D.
Since |R|=1, [R,R]=2R^2. Writing K:=(1/2)[D_R,D_R], note that K is a derivation of degree +2. Tot is generated from q=0 entries by cup-products and restrictions; if K vanishes on q=0 generators, then K≡0 on Tot.

Proposition 4.1 (degree-0 BCH).
Let g^0 be the degree-0 subalgebra generated by {L_X, J_c: |c|=0}. Under Assumption 3.1, [J_c,L_X]=0 and degree-0 incidence is commutative; hence exp(g^0)≅exp⟨L_X⟩×exp⟨J_c (|c|=0)⟩ with
exp(Θ)=exp(Σ_i λ_i L_{X_i})·exp(Σ_j κ_j J_{c_j}).
	5.	Homological perturbation with norm control.
Let (ι,π,h) be the standard Čech–de Rham contraction with πι=id_Ω and ιπ=id_Tot−Dh−hD (bounded at level s). Define
γ:=‖h‖( α‖E‖ + ‖β‖‖S‖‖L_X‖ ) < 1.            (5.1)
Then the Neumann series
h_R:=h ∑_{m≥0}(−Rh)^m
converges in operator norm and (ι,π,h_R) is a contraction between (Ω^*(M),d) and (Tot,D_R). Truncating after m terms yields the certified tail bound
‖ h_R − h ∑_{k=0}^m(−Rh)^k ‖ ≤ γ^{m+1}/(1−γ).     (5.2)
	6.	Energy–curvature equivalence and convexity.
Define the Robin energy
E_{α,β}(ψ):=∑_{i<j}∫_{U_{ij}} [ α‖ψ_i−ψ_j‖^2 + β_{ij}‖L_X(ψ_i+ψ_j)‖^2 ].
Under any of the standard boundary hypotheses (compact support in overlaps, X tangent to ∂U_{ij}, or cutoff vanishing at boundaries), the Euler–Lagrange equations equal the explicit q:0→2 edge-curvature identity equivalent to D_R^2=0 (use L_X=[d,ι_X] and integration by parts). If α≥α_0>0 and β_{ij}≥β_0>0, then E_{α,β} is strictly convex modulo constants; overlap minimizers are unique up to constants.
	7.	Algorithmic closure and admissible nonlinearities.
Let
G:= { linear: D_R, ι_X, L_X, J_a ; pointwise nonlinear: Φ_k }.
Each Φ_k acts componentwise with derivatives uniformly bounded on a fixed parameter box. By Proposition 4.1, degree-0 actions admit a canonical order; derivation rules propagate through products. Hence expressions built from G remain in the finite offline table family under differentiation and adjointing.
	8.	Fixed tile cover for real-time rendering.
Partition the image plane into a static grid of tiles {U_i} with maximal space–time neighbor count ν (e.g., 4 or 8 spatial plus one temporal). Maintain a constant-size per-tile state
ψ_i=(L̂_i, N_i, Z_i, ρ_i, σ_i^2, r_i, g_i),
where L̂=radiance, N=normal, Z=depth, ρ=material parameters, σ^2=variance proxy, r=single-entry reservoir, g=probe-cache vector. Define band-limited transports L_X as fixed-tap linear maps:
X_shad: shadow filtering (PCF/MSM) with K_shad taps;
X_ssr: screen-space reflection with step cap K_ssr and refinement K_bin;
X_taa: temporal reprojection and blend;
X_svgf: denoising with a fixed number of passes;
X_vol: stochastic volume steps against a majorant grid with a hard cap.
Degree-0 incidence J_c encodes per-tile light alias/hierarchy (top-K_light), probe neighborhoods (M_probe), and bounded update schedules; [J_c,L_X]=0. Pointwise Φ_k cover BRDF/LUT evaluation, MIS weights, clamps, acceptance tests, tone mapping, sharpening; all have uniformly bounded derivatives on a fixed parameter box.
	9.	Robin fusion for space–time gluing.
Along spatial/temporal edges employ
(Rψ){ij}:=α(ψ_i−ψ_j)+β{ij} L_{X_scr}(ψ_i+ψ_j).
Assumption 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 imply D_R^2=0 and preservation of Cartan identities. Thus overlap consistency is enforced locally with no global solve.
	10.	Offline tables and receipts (finite and fixed).
T1: matrices for E,S, restrictions, and each L_X on fixed local bases; SSR step maps; neighbor maps.
T2: degree-0 incidence: per-tile light alias/hierarchy (top-K_light), probe neighborhoods, update schedules; BCH tables.
T3: contraction data (ι,π,h), truncated h_R, adjoints E^,S^,L_X^,J_a^; measured receipts b_E:=‖E‖, b_S:=‖S‖, b_L:=‖L_X‖, b_β:=‖β‖, b_h:=‖h‖.
T4: BRDF/visibility LUTs with derivative tables; tone-mapper/clamp/acceptance-test derivatives.
Record
γ_bound:=b_h(α b_E + b_β b_S b_L),    m:=minimal Neumann order meeting (5.2),
ε_tail:=γ_bound^{m+1}/(1−γ_bound).
	11.	Certified caps (implementation constants).
Choose fixed integers
K_light=32,  K_shad=25 (PCF 5×5) or MSM 4-moment,  K_ssr=32,  K_bin=4,
K_nb=6 (4 orthogonal + 2 diagonals),  M_probe=12,
svgf_passes=3,  taa_half_life=8 frames,  reservoir_size=1,
and pick α,β so that γ_bound<1 with margin (e.g., ≤0.9). These caps are independent of the number of pixels, lights, or primitives.
	12.	Online constant-time pipeline (per tile).
F0 G-buffer: write ψ_i (degree-0).                            Cost: O(1).
F1 Direct light: J_light (K_light), Φ_brdf, L_{X_shad} (K_shad). Cost: O(1).
F2 Reflections: L_{X_ssr} (K_ssr + K_bin) with Φ_env fallback.   Cost: O(1).
F3 Reuse: E/S on K_nb neighbors + one temporal edge; fuse by R; update reservoir r_i (width 1).                                             Cost: O(1).
F4 GI: probe query on M_probe with bounded per-frame refresh via J_update, or ReSTIR-GI under the same caps.                                Cost: O(1).
F5 Denoise/TAA: L_{X_svgf} passes (svgf_passes) with Φ_gate clamps; L_{X_taa} reprojection + Φ_clamp + Φ_sharpen.                           Cost: O(1).
Each step is a constant-length word in the generators G with constant-size blocks; counts and sizes depend only on the caps and ν.

Definition 12.1 (O(1)/tile).
A kernel is O(1)/tile if time and memory per tile are bounded by a constant depending only on (ν, caps, receipts) and not on the number of pixels, lights, primitives, or expression depth.

Proposition 12.2 (explicit operation count).
Let C_lin be the worst-case number of scalar multiplies for a single fixed-size linear block, and C_nl for a Φ_k evaluation. Then one pass of F0–F5 uses at most
C_tot ≤ C_lin·(K_shad + K_ssr + K_bin + K_nb + M_probe + svgf_passes + c_0) + C_nl·c_1
operations per tile, where c_0,c_1 are absolute constants from degree-0 and LUT lookups. C_tot is independent of pixels, lights, and primitives.

Proof.
Count block invocations in F0–F5; each block has fixed dimensions. Summing yields the stated bound.
	13.	Differentiation and second-order products.
Forward JVP: apply the derivation rules with D_R; use Proposition 4.1 to commute degree-0 blocks; evaluate constant-size matrices and tabulated Φ′_k.
Reverse VJP: replace each block by its adjoint (E^, S^, L_X^, J_a^, Φ_k^), use h_R^ (truncated with tail bound (5.2)). HVP is the composition.
Theorem 13.1 (forward O(1)/tile).
Under (5.1) and fixed caps, JVP of any expression generated by G in F0–F5 is O(1)/tile.
Theorem 13.2 (reverse O(1)/tile).
Under the same hypotheses, VJP is O(1)/tile; the truncation error is ≤ε_tail from (5.2).
Corollary 13.3 (HVP O(1)/tile).
Hessian–vector products are O(1)/tile with the same constants.
Sketch of proofs.
Closure of G under differentiation keeps all derivatives within the finite offline table family; Φ_k differentiate to diagonal or block-diagonal factors with uniformly bounded derivatives. The BCH factorization gives a canonical commuting order for degree-0 blocks. D_R^2=0 implies differentiation commutes with the transfer induced by h_R. Operation counts follow from Proposition 12.2.
	14.	Stability and fixed-cost fallbacks.
Strict convexity of E_{α,β} on overlaps (α,β bounded away from 0) gives unique local fusions modulo constants. Degree-0 gauge (incidence rescalings) commutes with transports and is absorbed offline. Disocclusions and large motion are handled by Φ_reset clamps; SSR misses fall back to Φ_env; probe staleness is bounded by J_update. All fallbacks are degree-0 or band-limited and preserve O(1)/tile.
	15.	Minimal sanity check.
Two tiles U_1,U_2 with one spatial and one temporal edge. With constant X_scr,
(Rψ){12}=α(ψ_1−ψ_2)+β L{X_scr}(ψ_1+ψ_2).
Compute [d,R]=[L_{X_scr},αE+βS]. The q:0→2 identity
δ_tot(Rψ)+R(δ_totψ)+[d,R]ψ=0
holds explicitly; all tables are scalars and kernels are O(1)/tile by inspection.
	16.	Scope and limitations.
O(1)/tile guarantees require: fixed tile cover; fixed tap counts for each L_X; bounded derivatives for Φ_k on a fixed parameter box; γ<1 at level s; fixed reservoir width; bounded per-frame probe refresh. Changing any of these requires recomputation of T1–T4 and recertification.
	17.	Reproducibility and certification checklist.
(i) Record b_E,b_S,b_L,b_β,b_h and compute γ_bound. Verify γ_bound<1.
(ii) Fix caps {K_light,K_shad,K_ssr,K_bin,K_nb,M_probe,svgf_passes,taa constants,reservoir_size}.
(iii) Choose Neumann order m satisfying (5.2); store ε_tail.
(iv) Emit adjoint tables E^,S^,L_X^,J_a^ and Φ′_k,Φ_k^ for VJP/HVP.
(v) At runtime monitor a cheap bound ρ_eff≤γ_bound; if violated, refresh T1–T3 offline with updated norms.

Conclusion.
A derivational Robin twist produces a nilpotent D_R that preserves Cartan identities and admits a degree-0 BCH factorization. With a norm-controlled homological perturbation contraction, the global coupling collapses to fixed local operators. On a fixed tile cover, all rendering passes F0–F5—and their JVP, VJP, and HVP—execute in O(1) time and memory per tile, with explicit, certifiable constants and truncation error bounds independent of scene scale.
