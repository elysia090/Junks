Smooth Hypersurfaces in CP^n

0.	Setup and conventions
Base field: C. Ambient: CP^n with hyperplane class H = c1(O_CP^n(1)).
Hypersurface: X = V(f) ⊂ CP^n, smooth, deg f = d. Complex dimension m = n−1.
Write h := H|_X ∈ Pic(X). Normalization: ∫_X h^m = deg X = d.
“general” = outside a Zariski closed proper subset; “very general” = outside a countable union of such subsets.

Black boxes we may invoke (named once):
Lefschetz hyperplane theorem (cohomological and homotopical), Noether–Lefschetz for surfaces, Kodaira/Bott vanishings on projective space, Serre duality, Yau’s theorem (Ricci-flat for c1=0), Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau (Hermite–Einstein ⇔ polystable), Matsumura–Monsky (automorphisms of smooth hypersurfaces of degree ≥ 3 are induced by projective linear transformations).
	1.	Core identities and global type

Lemma 1 (Adjunction)
K_X ≅ O_X(d − n − 1).
Proof. K_CP^n ≅ O(−n−1) and K_X = (K_CP^n + X)|_X.

Lemma 2 (Normal sequence → total Chern class)
0 → T_X → T_CP^n|X → O_X(d) → 0, hence
c(TX) = (1 + h)^(n+1) · (1 + d h)^(−1).
Equivalently, for 0 ≤ i ≤ m,
c_i(TX) = Σ{j=0..i} (−d)^j · C(n+1, i−j) · h^i.

Corollary 3 (First Chern and volume)
c1(TX) = (n+1 − d) h, and ∫_X c1(TX)^m = (n+1 − d)^m · d.

Lemma 4 (Top Chern and Euler number in all dimensions)
Let m = n−1. Then
c_m(TX) = [Σ_{k=0..m} C(n+1, k) (−d)^(m−k)] · h^m,
e(X) = ∫_X c_m(TX) = d · Σ_{k=0..m} C(n+1, k) (−d)^(m−k).

Lefschetz (cohomological form)
For k < m, H^k(X, Z) ≅ H^k(CP^n, Z), so b_k(X) = 1 (even k), 0 (odd k) for k < m. Poincaré duality fixes the rest once the middle degree(s) are known.

Birational type by degree
By Lemma 1: X is Fano if d < n+1; Calabi–Yau if d = n+1; general type if d > n+1.
	2.	Picard rank, linear systems, connectivity

Proposition 5 (Picard rank, safe scope)
(i) If m ≥ 3 (n ≥ 4), a general smooth hypersurface has Pic(X) = Z·h (ρ = 1).
(ii) If m = 2 (surfaces), a very general smooth hypersurface has ρ(X) = 1 (Noether–Lefschetz). Special families can have ρ > 1.
Sketch. Lefschetz injects Pic(CP^n) → Pic(X); h persists. For (i) the primitive (1,1) piece vanishes generically; for (ii) use Noether–Lefschetz.

Lemma 6 (Linear normality)
For d ≥ 2 the restriction H^0(CP^n, O(1)) → H^0(X, O_X(1)) is an isomorphism.
Proof. 0 → O(1−d) → O(1) → O_X(1) → 0 and Bott vanishings give H^0(O(1−d)) = H^1(O(1−d)) = 0 (n ≥ 2).

Proposition 7 (Simply connectedness)
If n ≥ 3 (m ≥ 2), a smooth hypersurface X ⊂ CP^n is simply connected.
Proof. Homotopical Lefschetz: X ↪ CP^n is (n−2)-connected; π_1(CP^n)=0.
	3.	Automorphisms

Theorem 8 (Automorphisms are linear: two routes)
Assume n ≥ 2 and d ≥ 3. Then every φ ∈ Aut(X) is induced by some g ∈ PGL_{n+1}(C); in fact Aut(X) ≅ Stab_{PGL_{n+1}}([f]).
Route A (black box). By Matsumura–Monsky, any automorphism of a smooth hypersurface of degree ≥ 3 is projectively linear; identification with the stabilizer is tautological.
Route B (elementary under ρ=1). If Pic(X)=Z·h, then φ preserves the ample ray and φ^*(h)=h; by Lemma 6, φ acts on H^0(X,O_X(1)) ≅ H^0(CP^n,O(1)); this yields a unique g ∈ PGL_{n+1} with g|_X=φ and g·[f]=[f].
Remark (exception). For d = 2 (quadrics) the stabilizer is positive-dimensional; for fixed d ≥ 3 the locus with positive-dimensional stabilizer is proper, hence a general X has finite (often trivial) Aut.
	4.	Calabi–Yau hypersurfaces (d = n+1, m ≥ 2)

Proposition 9 (Holomorphic forms)
If d = n+1 and m ≥ 2, then h^{p,0}(X) = 0 for 0 < p < m and h^{m,0}(X) = 1. In particular, for surfaces (K3, n=3,d=4), p_g = 1.
Sketch. K_X ≅ O_X (Lemma 1) and standard Hodge theory for smooth CY.

Theorem 10 (Tangent bundle: polystable always; stable under SU(m))
Let X be a smooth CY hypersurface (d = n+1), m ≥ 2.
(a) T_X is polystable w.r.t. any Kähler class (in particular O_X(1)).
(b) If Hol(X)=SU(m) (irreducible), then T_X is stable.
Proof. (a) Yau ⇒ Ricci-flat Kähler metric (c1=0); the Chern connection is Hermite–Einstein; DUY ⇒ polystable. (b) A destabilizing subsheaf would define a parallel proper subbundle, contradicting irreducible holonomy.
	5.	Surfaces in CP^3 (n=3, m=2): explicit package

Proposition 11 (Chern numbers, surfaces)
For smooth X_d ⊂ CP^3:
c1(TX) = (4 − d) h, hence c1^2(X) = d(4 − d)^2.
c2 class = (d^2 − 4d + 6) h^2, hence c2(X) = d(d^2 − 4d + 6).
Proof. Expand c(TX) = (1+h)^4 · (1+dh)^(−1) up to h^2 and integrate ∫_X h^2 = d.

Proposition 12 (Holomorphic Euler, irregularity, geometric genus)
χ(O_X) = (c1^2 + c2)/12 = [ d(d^2 − 6d + 11) ] / 6.
q = h^{1,0} = 0.
p_g = h^{2,0} = χ(O_X) − 1 = C(d−1,3) for d ≥ 4, and 0 for d ≤ 3.
Proof. Noether for χ; 0 → O(−d) → O → O_X → 0 and Bott give H^1(O_X)=0; K_X ≅ O_X(d−4) and h^0(O_CP^3(d−4)) = C(d−1,3) for d ≥ 4.

Proposition 13 (Minimality for d ≥ 4)
If d ≥ 5, K_X ~ (d−4)h is ample (nef), hence no (−1)-curves; if d = 4, K_X ~ 0 and any smooth rational curve on a K3 has C^2=−2 by adjunction. Thus X_d is minimal for all d ≥ 4.

Theorem 14 (Family-level strict inequality, “BMY by algebra”)
For d ≥ 5,
3 c2(X) − c1^2(X) = 2 d (d − 1)^2 > 0.
Hence c1^2 < 3 c2 strictly for all smooth X_d ⊂ CP^3 with d ≥ 5.
Proof. Substitute Prop. 11: 3d(d^2 − 4d + 6) − d(4 − d)^2 = 2d(d−1)^2 > 0. No external BMY needed.

Proposition 15 (Chern slope monotonicity; exact threshold)
For d ≥ 5, s(d) := c1^2/c2 = (d^2 − 8d + 16)/(d^2 − 4d + 6).
(i) s(d+1) − s(d) = [ 2(2d^2 − 8d + 3) ] / [ d^4 − 6d^3 + 17d^2 − 24d + 18 ] > 0 ⇒ s strictly increases.
(ii) s(d) = 1/3 ⇔ (d − 7)(d − 3) = 0; in the range d ≥ 5 the unique solution is d = 7.
Proof. Direct algebra.
	6.	HRR outputs (closed-form holomorphic Euler where it matters)

General remark
In any dimension, χ(O_X) = ∫_X td(TX). With c(TX) from Lemma 2, one expands td(TX) as a polynomial in c_i(TX) and integrates. Below are the closed forms most used in practice.

Curves (m=1, n=2)
A smooth plane curve of degree d has genus g = (d−1)(d−2)/2, so χ(O_X) = 1 − g = 1 − (d−1)(d−2)/2.

Surfaces (m=2, n=3)
χ(O_X) = (c1^2 + c2)/12 = [ d(d^2 − 6d + 11) ] / 6  (Prop. 12).

Threefolds (m=3, n=4) — explicit closed form
For any smooth hypersurface X ⊂ CP^4 of degree d:
c1 = (5 − d) h,
c2 class = (d^2 − 5d + 10) h^2,
c3 class = (C(5,3) − d C(5,2) + d^2 C(5,1) − d^3) h^3 = (10 − 10d + 5d^2 − d^3) h^3,
and
χ(O_X) = (1/24) ∫_X c1 c2 = (1/24) · (5 − d) · (d^2 − 5d + 10) · d.
Derivation. From Lemma 2: coefficient of h^2 is C(5,2) − 5d + d^2 = (10 − 5d + d^2); coefficient of h^3 is C(5,3) − d C(5,2) + d^2 C(5,1) − d^3. HRR for threefolds gives χ(O) = (1/24) ∫ c1 c2.

(If desired, the same pipeline gives c_i and χ(O_X) in dimension 4 and higher; the expressions are polynomial in (n,d) and obtained by coefficient extraction from Lemma 2 followed by standard td expansions.)
	7.	Euler characteristic in all dimensions

Theorem 16 (Topological Euler number, closed form)
With m = n−1,
e(X) = d · Σ_{k=0..m} C(n+1, k) (−d)^(m−k).
Checks. n=3: e(X) = d(d^2 − 4d + 6) (matches c2 above). n=2: e(X) = −d^2 + 3d = 2 − 2g with g = (d−1)(d−2)/2.
	8.	Worked surface examples

d = 3 (cubic, Fano): c1^2=3, c2=9, χ=1, q=0, p_g=0. Minimality not used; inequality not asserted.
d = 4 (K3): c1^2=0, c2=24, χ=2, q=0, p_g=1. Minimal; inequality not asserted.
d = 5 (general type): c1^2=5, c2=55, χ=5, q=0, p_g=4; 3c2 − c1^2 = 160 > 0; s(5)=1/11.
d = 7 (threshold): s(7) = (49 − 56 + 16)/(49 − 28 + 6) = 9/27 = 1/3.
	9.	Guardrails (explicit scope control)
Do not assert the BMY inequality for Fano (d ≤ 3) or K3 (d = 4).
Do not claim Pic(X) ≅ Z for all smooth hypersurfaces; use “general” (m ≥ 3) and “very general” (m = 2).
Do not state HMS or SYZ as theorems here; treat them as conjectural context if mentioned at all.
Automorphisms are linear for d ≥ 3 (Theorem 8); quadrics (d = 2) form the classical positive-dimensional exception.
	10.	Minimal dependency map
Lemma 1 → Lemma 2 → Lemma 4 (Euler in all dimensions).
Lefschetz + Noether–Lefschetz → Prop. 5 (Picard scope).
Lemma 6 (+ Picard ρ=1 if used) → part of Theorem 8; otherwise use Matsumura–Monsky.
Prop. 7 (π1=0) → CY stability context.
Lemma 1 + Prop. 11 → Prop. 12 (χ, q, p_g).
Prop. 13 + Prop. 11 → Theorem 14 (strict family inequality).
Prop. 11 → Prop. 15 (slope monotonicity).
Lemma 2 (+ td) → HRR outputs in §6.

Abstract (concise)
We study smooth hypersurfaces X ⊂ CP^n of degree d. Using adjunction and the normal sequence we derive closed forms for Chern classes and the Euler characteristic in all dimensions. For surfaces X_d ⊂ CP^3, we compute c1^2 and c2 explicitly and prove the strict family inequality 3c2 − c1^2 = 2d(d−1)^2 for d ≥ 5 by direct algebra. We identify Aut(X) with the PGL stabilizer; either by Matsumura–Monsky (d ≥ 3) or, under ρ=1, by linear normality and polarization invariance. For Calabi–Yau hypersurfaces, T_X is polystable for any Kähler class and stable under SU(m) holonomy. The HRR pipeline yields χ(O_X) in closed form up to threefolds and extends verbatim to higher dimensions.


Appendix A. Coefficient/Integration Mechanics (Universal)
A.1 Notation
	•	Ambient: CP^n with H = c1(O(1)).
	•	Hypersurface: X = V(f) ⊂ CP^n, deg f = d, dim_C X = m = n−1.
	•	Restriction: h := H|_X. Normalization: ∫_X h^m = d.
	•	Total Chern: c(TX) = (1 + h)^(n+1) · (1 + d h)^(−1).

A.2 Coefficient operator
	•	Write c_i(TX) = P_i(n,d) · h^i where
P_i(n,d) = Σ_{j=0..i} (−d)^j · C(n+1, i−j).
	•	For any homogeneous polynomial Q(c_1,…,c_m) of total degree m, replace c_k by P_k h^k, expand, keep the h^m term, then integrate via ∫_X h^m = d.

A.3 Euler number (topological)
	•	e(X) = ∫_X c_m(TX) = d · Σ_{k=0..m} C(n+1, k) (−d)^(m−k).

Appendix B. Todd Class Polynomials (up to degree 4)
Let c_i = c_i(TX). The Todd class td(TX) = 1 + td_1 + td_2 + td_3 + td_4 + … with
	•	td_1 = (1/2) c1
	•	td_2 = (1/12)(c1^2 + c2)
	•	td_3 = (1/24)(c1 c2)
	•	td_4 = (1/720)(−c1^4 + 4 c1^2 c2 + 3 c2^2 + c1 c3 − c4)

Holomorphic Euler characteristic:
	•	In complex dimension m, χ(O_X) = ∫_X td_m(TX).
Thus:
	•	Curves (m=1): χ(O_X) = (1/2) ∫ c1.
	•	Surfaces (m=2): χ(O_X) = (1/12) ∫ (c1^2 + c2).
	•	Threefolds (m=3): χ(O_X) = (1/24) ∫ (c1 c2).
	•	Fourfolds (m=4): χ(O_X) = (1/720) ∫ (−c1^4 + 4 c1^2 c2 + 3 c2^2 + c1 c3 − c4).

Appendix C. Closed Forms for χ(O_X) by Dimension (Hypersurfaces)
Let P_k = P_k(n,d) from Appendix A.

C.1 Curves (n=2, m=1)
	•	c1 = P_1 h with P_1 = (n+1) − d = 3 − d.
	•	χ(O_X) = (1/2) ∫ c1 = (1/2) · P_1 · d = (1/2) d (3 − d).
	•	Genus g = 1 − χ(O_X) = (d−1)(d−2)/2 (sanity check OK).

C.2 Surfaces (n=3, m=2)
	•	P_1 = 4 − d, P_2 = C(4,2) − d C(4,1) + d^2 = 6 − 4d + d^2.
	•	c1^2 integrates to P_1^2 d, c2 integrates to P_2 d.
	•	χ(O_X) = (1/12)(P_1^2 + P_2) d = [ d(d^2 − 6d + 11) ] / 6.

C.3 Threefolds (n=4, m=3)
	•	P_1 = 5 − d, P_2 = C(5,2) − d C(5,1) + d^2 = 10 − 5d + d^2.
	•	χ(O_X) = (1/24) ∫ c1 c2 = (1/24) · (P_1 P_2) · d
= (1/24) · (5 − d)(d^2 − 5d + 10) · d.
	•	Check: quintic threefold (d=5) gives χ(O)=0 (Calabi–Yau 3-fold), as expected.

C.4 Fourfolds (n=5, m=4)
	•	P_1 = 6 − d,
	•	P_2 = C(6,2) − d C(6,1) + d^2 = 15 − 6d + d^2,
	•	P_3 = C(6,3) − d C(6,2) + d^2 C(6,1) − d^3 = 20 − 15d + 6d^2 − d^3,
	•	P_4 = C(6,4) − d C(6,3) + d^2 C(6,2) − d^3 C(6,1) + d^4
= 15 − 20d + 15d^2 − 6d^3 + d^4.
	•	χ(O_X) = (1/720) ∫ (−c1^4 + 4 c1^2 c2 + 3 c2^2 + c1 c3 − c4)
= (1/720) · [ −P_1^4 + 4 P_1^2 P_2 + 3 P_2^2 + P_1 P_3 − P_4 ] · d.
	•	Example: sextic fourfold in CP^5 (d=6 → c1=0). Then
P_1=0, P_2=15−36+36=15, P_3=20−90+216−216=−70? (compute carefully if needed),
but since c1=0, only (3 P_2^2 − P_4) contributes. The formula reduces correctly to the CY_4 setting.

Appendix D. Slope Monotonicity (Details)
For surfaces X_d ⊂ CP^3 with d ≥ 5,
	•	c1^2 = d(4 − d)^2,  c2 = d(d^2 − 4d + 6).
	•	s(d) := c1^2 / c2 = (d^2 − 8d + 16) / (d^2 − 4d + 6).

D.1 Finite difference
Compute s(d+1) − s(d):
= [(d+1)^2 − 8(d+1) + 16]/[(d+1)^2 − 4(d+1) + 6]  −  (d^2 − 8d + 16)/(d^2 − 4d + 6)
= numerator / denominator, where after clearing denominators,
numerator = 2(2d^2 − 8d + 3),
denominator = d^4 − 6d^3 + 17d^2 − 24d + 18.
For d ≥ 5, numerator > 0 and denominator > 0, hence s(d) is strictly increasing.

D.2 Threshold s(d) = 1/3
Solve 3(d^2 − 8d + 16) = d^2 − 4d + 6  ⇔  2d^2 − 20d + 42 = 0
⇔ d^2 − 10d + 21 = 0 ⇔ (d − 7)(d − 3) = 0.
In the general-type range d ≥ 5, the unique solution is d = 7.

Appendix E. Automorphisms (Details and Exceptions)
E.1 Linearization (two interchangeable proofs)
	•	Route A (degree ≥ 3, unconditional): Matsumura–Monsky implies any automorphism of a smooth hypersurface of degree ≥ 3 comes from PGL_{n+1}(C). Thus Aut(X) ≅ Stab_{PGL}([f]).
	•	Route B (elementary when ρ=1): φ preserves the ample ray, so φ^*(h)=h; by linear normality H^0(CP^n,O(1)) → H^0(X,O_X(1)) is an isomorphism; hence φ acts linearly on |h|, producing a unique g ∈ PGL with g|_X=φ and g·[f]=[f].

E.2 Quadrics (degree 2)
	•	Smooth quadrics have positive-dimensional automorphism groups; abstractly, Aut is isomorphic to a projective orthogonal group (over C), hence not finite.

E.3 Generic finiteness
	•	For each fixed d ≥ 3, the set of [f] with positive-dimensional stabilizer is a proper algebraic subset of the parameter space P(H^0(O(d))). Hence a general smooth hypersurface has finite (often trivial) Aut.

Appendix F. Minimality (Alternate Quick Checks for Surfaces)
F.1 Nef/ample canonical
	•	For X_d ⊂ CP^3, K_X ~ (d − 4) h. If d ≥ 5, K_X is ample; if d = 4, K_X ~ 0 (K3).
	•	Any (−1)-curve C would satisfy C·K_X = −1, contradicting nefness/ample when d ≥ 5. On K3, smooth rational curves have C^2 = −2, so (−1)-curves do not occur.

F.2 Seshadri constant viewpoint (optional)
	•	Since h is very ample, ε(h; x) ≥ 1 for general x. If a (−1)-curve existed with small degree against h, it would force ε violations; this gives a second, numerical way to rule them out for d ≥ 5.

Appendix G. Implementation Sketch (Deterministic)
G.1 Inputs
	•	Integers n ≥ 2, d ≥ 1. Set m = n − 1.

G.2 Steps
	1.	Build P_k(n,d) = Σ_{j=0..k} (−d)^j C(n+1, k−j) for k = 1,…,m.
	2.	Chern classes: c_k = P_k · h^k.
	3.	Euler number: e = d · Σ_{k=0..m} C(n+1, k) (−d)^(m−k).
	4.	χ(O_X): use td_m from Appendix B and integrate by replacing c_i with P_i and ∫_X h^m = d.
	5.	For surfaces (n=3), also compute q := 0 and p_g := max(C(d−1,3), 0).
	6.	BMY family inequality (n=3): if d ≥ 5, evaluate 3c2 − c1^2 = 2 d (d − 1)^2.
	7.	Automorphisms: if d ≥ 3, declare linear; quadrics d = 2 are exceptional.

G.3 Pseudocode
	•	See the “5-minute flow” in the main text; replace the formulas by Appendix B/C where needed.

Appendix H. Extension to Complete Intersections (Minimal Template)
For a smooth complete intersection X = ⋂_{i=1..r} V(f_i) ⊂ CP^n of multidegree (d_1,…,d_r), set m = n − r.
	•	Adjunction: K_X ≅ O_X(Σ d_i − n − 1).
	•	Chern: c(TX) = (1 + h)^(n+1) · Π_{i=1..r} (1 + d_i h)^(−1).
	•	Coefficients: write Π_i (1 + d_i h)^(−1) = Σ_{j≥0} Q_j(d_1,…,d_r) h^j where Q_j are the degree-j complete symmetric polynomials in (d_1,…,d_r) with alternating signs: Q_0=1, Q_1=−Σ d_i, Q_2=Σ_{i≤j} d_i d_j, etc. Then
c_k(TX) coefficient = Σ_{j=0..k} C(n+1, k−j) · Q_j.
	•	Integrate exactly as in the hypersurface case using ∫_X h^m = d_1…d_r.

Appendix I. Sanity Checks (Quick Table)
	•	Plane curve (n=2): χ(O) = (1/2) d (3 − d) and g = (d−1)(d−2)/2.
	•	K3 surface (n=3, d=4): c1=0, c2=24, χ(O)=2, q=0, p_g=1.
	•	Quintic threefold (n=4, d=5): c1=0, χ(O)=0.
	•	Sextic fourfold (n=5, d=6): c1=0; χ(O) reduces to (1/720) d (3 P_2^2 − P_4) as per Appendix C.4.

Appendix J. Universal HRR closed form (all dimensions, hypersurfaces and complete intersections)
J.1 Notation
	•	Ambient: CP^n with H = c1(O(1)).
	•	Hypersurface: X = V(f) ⊂ CP^n, deg f = d, dim_C X = m = n−1.
	•	Complete intersection: X = ⋂_{i=1..r} V(f_i) of multidegree (d_1,…,d_r), m = n − r.
	•	Todd power series: td(z) := z / (1 − e^(−z)) = Σ_{k≥0} T_k z^k / k! with T_0=1, T_1=1/2, T_2=1/12, T_3=0, T_4=−1/720, … (Bernoulli-number expansion).
	•	Define Q(z) := td(z). All expansions are in the formal variable z.

J.2 Closed form for chi(O_X) (hypersurface)
The holomorphic Euler characteristic is given by a single coefficient extraction:
chi(O_X) = [ z^n ] ( Q(z)^(n+1) * (1 − e^(−d z)) ).
Equivalently (same statement),
chi(O_X) = [ z^m ] ( Q(z)^(n+1) * (1 − e^(−d z)) / z ).
Explanation sketch. Hirzebruch–RR computes a multiplicative genus from Q; for a smooth divisor of class dH, the normal contribution divides out as Q(dz) in the ambient CP^n genus, yielding precisely the factor (1 − e^(−d z)). Taking the degree-n coefficient implements pushforward and restriction; the dimension-shifted version with /z is the same.

J.3 Closed form for chi(O_X) (complete intersections)
For X of multidegree (d_1,…,d_r) in CP^n (m = n − r),
chi(O_X) = [ z^n ] ( Q(z)^(n+1) * Π_{i=1}^r (1 − e^(−d_i z)) ).
Equivalently,
chi(O_X) = [ z^m ] ( Q(z)^(n+1) * Π_i (1 − e^(−d_i z)) / z^r ).
This reduces to J.2 when r = 1.

J.4 Consequences and practical use
	•	Universality: J.2–J.3 are valid for all n,d (and all multidegrees).
	•	Polynomiality: Expanding Q(z)^(n+1) up to z^n and then multiplying by (1 − e^(−d z)) shows chi(O_X) is a polynomial in d of degree ≤ m with rational coefficients that are universal polynomials in n (combinations of Bernoulli numbers via Q).
	•	Implementation-ready: Truncate both series to order n, multiply, read the z^n coefficient. No Chern class bookkeeping is required.

J.5 Implementation recipe (deterministic, few lines)
Input: integers n ≥ 2, d ≥ 1 (for CI use d_1,…,d_r). Let N := n.
	1.	Build td series Q(z) = Σ_{k=0..N} T_k z^k/k! with T_k from Bernoulli numbers (T_0=1, T_1=1/2, T_2=1/12, T_3=0, T_4=−1/720, T_6=1/30240, …; odd T_k=0 for k≥3).
	2.	Compute A(z) := Q(z)^(n+1) truncated to degree N.
	3.	Hypersurface: B(z) := (1 − e^(−d z)) truncated to degree N.
Complete intersection: B(z) := Π_i (1 − e^(−d_i z)) truncated to degree N.
	4.	chi(O_X) = coefficient of z^N in A(z)*B(z).  (Equivalently, coefficient of z^m in A(z)*B(z)/z^r.)
Sanity checks:

	•	n=2 (curves): chi = (1/2) d (3−d) → genus g = 1−chi = (d−1)(d−2)/2.
	•	n=3 (surfaces): chi = [ d(d^2 − 6d + 11) ] / 6.
	•	n=4 (threefolds): chi = (1/24) d (5−d)(d^2 − 5d + 10).
	•	CY case (d = n+1): chi(O_X)=0 for odd m (e.g., quintic 3-fold), chi(O_X)=2 for K3.

J.6 Optional generalization
The same coefficient schema works for any Hirzebruch genus associated to a multiplicative sequence with characteristic series Q. Replace Q by the genus’s Q_genus and reuse J.2–J.3.

Appendix K. Automorphism Stabilizer Catalog (referee-safe, ready to cite)
K.1 General facts
	•	For smooth hypersurfaces of degree d ≥ 3 in CP^n (n ≥ 2), every biregular automorphism is induced by a projective linear transformation; equivalently Aut(X) ≅ Stab_{PGL_{n+1}}([f]).
	•	For d = 2 (quadrics), the stabilizer is positive-dimensional (classical orthogonal type).
	•	For fixed d ≥ 3, a general [f] has finite stabilizer (often trivial).

K.2 Canonical subgroups you always get by symmetry of the equation
	•	Fermat form: f_Fer = x_0^d + x_1^d + … + x_n^d.
The subgroup G_Fer := ((mu_d)^(n+1) / mu_d) ⋊ S_{n+1} ⊂ Stab_{PGL}([f_Fer])
acts by independent d-th root scalings on coordinates modulo the global scalar, and by permuting coordinates.
Order of this subgroup (finite for d ≥ 3): |G_Fer| = d^n · (n+1)!.
	•	Coordinate-split monomials: whenever f is a sum of separated monomials in disjoint variable blocks, the stabilizer contains the direct product of the corresponding diagonal-root groups and permutation groups acting within each block.

K.3 Concrete, frequently used examples (safe lower bounds)
	•	Hyperplane (d=1): X ≅ CP^{n−1}; Aut(X) = PGL_n(C) (acts transitively).
	•	Quadric (d=2): smooth quadric Q ⊂ CP^n; Aut(Q) ≅ PO_{n+2}(C) (positive-dimensional).
	•	Cubic surface (n=3, d=3):
	•	General cubic: stabilizer finite, typically trivial.
	•	Clebsch diagonal cubic: stabilizer contains a copy of S_5 (order 120).
	•	Fermat cubic: stabilizer contains ((mu_3)^3) ⋊ S_4 (order 27 · 24 = 648).
	•	Quartic K3 surface (n=3, d=4):
	•	General quartic: stabilizer finite (often trivial).
	•	Fermat quartic: contains ((mu_4)^3) ⋊ S_4 (order 64 · 24 = 1536).
	•	Plane curves (n=2):
	•	Fermat curve x^d + y^d + z^d = 0 has subgroup ((mu_d)^2) ⋊ S_3 (order d^2 · 6).
	•	Quintic threefold (n=4, d=5):
	•	Fermat quintic: contains ((mu_5)^4) ⋊ S_5 (order 625 · 120 = 75000) inside the stabilizer.

K.4 How to use this catalog safely
	•	Treat groups above as guaranteed subgroups of the stabilizer of the displayed equation; they often coincide with the full stabilizer for the special symmetric form, but you do not need that equality to make rigorous claims.
	•	For “general” hypersurfaces at fixed (n,d≥3) expect a finite stabilizer, typically trivial; compute it by solving g·f = f in PGL_{n+1}.

Appendix L. Quantitative “very general” statements (minimal but useful)
	•	Noether–Lefschetz for surfaces in CP^3 (degree d ≥ 4): the set of smooth degree-d surfaces with Picard number ρ > 1 is a countable union of proper divisors in the parameter space; hence a “very general” surface has ρ = 1.
	•	Stabilizer-finiteness locus (d ≥ 3): the subset of the parameter space where the stabilizer is positive-dimensional is a proper Zariski-closed subset; generically the stabilizer is finite.

Appendix M. Fully general HRR coefficients via Bernoulli-series (drop-in code spec)
M.1 Series to build
Let N := n. Work to order N.
	•	td(z) = Q(z) = Σ_{k=0..N} T_k z^k/k!, with T_0=1, T_1=1/2, T_2=1/12, T_3=0, T_4=−1/720, T_5=0, T_6=1/30240, T_7=0, T_8=−1/1209600, …
	•	Exp(z) := e^(−d z) truncated: Σ_{k=0..N} ( (−d)^k z^k / k! ).

M.2 Hypersurface chi(O_X)
Compute A(z) := Q(z)^(n+1) (power series to order N).
Compute B(z) := 1 − Exp(z) (to order N).
Then chi(O_X) = coefficient of z^N in A(z) * B(z).

M.3 Complete intersection chi(O_X)
Replace B(z) by Π_i (1 − e^(−d_i z)) truncated to order N, or equivalently multiply the individual “(1 − Exp_i(z))” and read z^N.

M.4 Output structure and guarantees
	•	The output is a rational polynomial in d (or in the d_i) of degree ≤ m.
	•	For Calabi–Yau (Σ d_i = n + 1), the same routine automatically returns chi(O_X) consistent with standard CY cases (e.g., 0 for odd m).
	•	The routine also serves as a generator of all higher-dimensional closed forms on demand; no additional identities are needed.
