Linear Memory Unit x Streaming Attention Unit x Input Encoder Unit x Output Generator Unit x Cluster x Multimodal
A Constant-Time, Auditable, Streaming Architecture for Distributed Multimodal Seq2Seq (Plain ASCII, ultra-detailed)

ABSTRACT
We extend the constant-time, auditable pairing of the Linear Memory Unit (LMU) and Streaming Attention Unit (SAU) encoder/decoder stack to (i) a clustered, horizontally scalable deployment and (ii) native multimodal integration (text, audio, image, video, tabular, sensor). All hot-path operations remain strictly bounded O(1) per token/patch/frame on each node, with fixed constants per modality. We define sharding, colocation, cross-modal attention via SAU with predictable gates learned by LMU, cluster-wide risk orchestration using anytime-valid e-processes, and a Merkle-chained audit tree that aggregates per-shard proofs to a single root. Snapshot/restore is deterministic; readers never stall; fallbacks remain exact via LMU.

0. NOTATION AND SCOPE
   Modalities M in {txt, aud, img, vid, tab, sens}.
   For each modality m: feature dim d_m, value dim d_v,m, PRF count r_m (fixed), optional low rank r_v,m (fixed), decay gamma_m in (0,1].
   Tokens are subwords (txt), frames/hops (aud), patches (img), tubelets (vid), rows (tab), events (sens).
   Cluster comprises shards S = {S_1..S_K}. Sessions are sticky-routed to one "home" shard; cross-modal memories may be co-located or mirrored.
   Predictable == F_{t - 1}-measurable; all logs are natural; IEEE-754 double; Kahan on decayed sums.

1. OBJECTS (PER MODALITY AND SHARD)
1.1 Linear Memory Unit (LMU, lossless hashed linear model, exact)
   Base: MPHF h, arrays W_base, Keys_base, ver_base.
   Delta: bounded cuckoo D(d,b,S,L,Q), stash S, overflow ring Q, emergency 1, ver_delta.
   O(1) bounds: C_lookup <= d*b+S+1 (e.g., <= 17), C_insert <= d*b+L+S+1+c0 (e.g., <= 25+c0).
   Scheduling inequality: C*(tau_high - tau_low) >= lambda_max*T_rb + margin.

1.2 Streaming Attention Unit SAU_m (per-modality SAU state)
PRF basis W_m (r_m x d_m), secret seed per shard; optional pairing (w, - w); clip g in [-c_m, c_m].
Sufficient statistics: R_m (r_m x d_v,m or r_m x r_v,m), s_m (r_m).
Preconditioner: mu_m, sigma^2_m (EWM2); query-only whitening.
Risk: e-process mixture E_mix,m(t); margin m_m(t)=log(1/alpha_m) - log E_mix,m(t).
RJ diagnostic: RJ_gap_m via coordinate half-split.

1.3 Input Encoder Unit IEU_m (streaming encoder per modality)
Reversible tokenizer/featureizer -> embeddings x_t^m -> K/V heads -> SAU_m ingest; emits sparse LMU ids for metadata/diagnostics.

1.4 Output Generator Unit (OGU decoder)
Self-attention SAU_txt over generated tokens; cross-modal attention SAU_m over encoder memories; LMU gate and linear add-on; risk-aware sampler.

1.5 Cluster control
ShardRouter (session sticky hashing), ModalColocator, RiskOrchestrator (cluster-level safety), AuditRoot (Merkle tree root combiner), Snapshotter.

2. MULTIMODAL TOKENIZATION (O(1)/EVENT PER NODE)
   2.1 Text (txt): BPE/SP + byte fallback; emit (tok_id, span, digest).
   2.2 Audio (aud): fixed hop H, window W; token = STFT frame or learned codec frame; x_t^aud in R^{d_aud}.
   2.3 Image (img): fixed grid patches P x P or learned tokenizer; x_t^img in R^{d_img}; token index carries spatial tile id.
   2.4 Video (vid): tubelet tokenization (P x P x T) with fixed T; x_t^vid in R^{d_vid}.
   2.5 Tabular (tab): row event or chunk; x_t^tab in R^{d_tab}; missing-value masks embedded.
   2.6 Sensor (sens): event token with bounded feature length; x_t^sens in R^{d_sens}.
   All IEU_m compute K/V and call SAU_m.ingest in O(r_m d_m)+O(r_m d_v,m) and emit LMU ids (e.g., modality, tile/patch bins, SNR bins, timestamp buckets).

3. CROSS-MODAL ATTENTION AND FUSION (CONSTANT FAN-IN)
   3.1 Query construction (decoder step t)
   q_t^self = W_q * Emb(y_{t - 1}) + small_state
   q_t^cross,m = CrossProj_m(Emb(y_{t - 1}), ctx) // small linear maps, O(d)

3.2 SAU readouts (bounded to M_used modalities)
For each selected modality m in a fixed set M_used (e.g., {txt,self} union top-K from prior step logits; K fixed small):
phi_q^m = PRF_m(q_t^cross,m); phi_w^m = whiten_m(phi_q^m; sigma^2_m)
den_m = phi_w^m^T s_m + lambda_*^m(t) // >= beta_floor,m
y_hat_m = (phi_w^m^T R_m) / den_m // or U_m( . ) if low-rank
Return {y_hat_self, y_hat_m | m in M_used}, {den_m}, {RJ_m}, {margins m_m}.

Reference formulas (per modality)
    - Feature map: phi_i^m(x) = r_m^{-1/2} exp(w_{m,i}^ top x / sqrt tau_m - ||x||^2/(2tau_m)).
    - Ingest update: R_{m,t} = gamma_m R_{m,t - 1} + phi^m(k_t^m) (v_t^m)^ top ,
     s_{m,t} = gamma_m s_{m,t - 1} + phi^m(k_t^m).
    - Query whitening: phi_w^m(q) = diag(sigma_m^2 + epsilon)^{-1/2} phi^m(q).
    - Readout: y_hat_m(q) = (phi_w^m(q)^ top R_{m,t}) / (phi_w^m(q)^ top s_{m,t} + lambda_*^m(t)).
    - Risk margin: E_mix,m(t) = sum_{lambda in Lambda_m} pi_{m,lambda} exp(sum_{i <= t} lambda g_{m,i} - psi_{m,i}(lambda)),
     m_m(t) = log(1/alpha_m) - log E_mix,m(t).

3.3 LMU-learned gates (interpretable, constant-time)
Diagnostics vector z_t = [ RJ_self, {RJ_m}, margin_self, {margin_m}, den_self, {den_m}, ||phi_w^self||*1, ctx bins, rolling |e| ].
LMU computes:
G_self = sigma(w_self^T z_t)
G_m = softmax over m in M_used of (u_m^T z_t) // simplex weights across modalities, K fixed
Context c_t = G_self * y_hat_self + sum*{m in M_used} G_m * y_hat_m
Optional meta-linear head (LMU) on [y_hat_self, {y_hat_m}] for 2 - (K+1) dims.

3.4 Logits and linear add-ons
z_lin = LMU.Linear(x_dec_ids) // exact sparse
logits_t = W_out * c_t + b_out + z_lin

3.5 Risk-aware sampling (predictable)
margin* = min( margin_self, min_m margin_m )
temperature_t = f_T(margin*) // nonincreasing in risk
(top_k, top_p) = f_filter(margin*, RJ stats)
If margin* < 0 or persistent RJ "red": clamp G_self down , shrink {G_m} to safer modalities (e.g., txt,img), raise beta_floor,* and lambda_*^* predictably.

4. CLUSTER TOPOLOGY (SESSION-STICKY, CONSTANT FAN-OUT)
   4.1 Sharding / colocation
    - Session-sticky consistent hashing -> home shard S_h.
    - Text decoder (OGU) lives at S_h.
    - Encoders for modalities co-located where possible (ModalColocator makes placement; img/vid ideally on GPU nodes).
    - Cross-shard reads use bounded fan-in <= K_mod (e.g., 3 modalities) via RPC with streaming caches; K_mod is fixed -> O(1) per token fan-out.

4.2 Data paths (ASCII)

[Clients] -> (Ingress Gate) -> [ShardRouter]
  -> S_h:   OGU(txt self), LMU(gate/linear), SAU_txt(dec)
  -> S_img: IEU_img + SAU_img(enc)
  -> S_aud: IEU_aud + SAU_aud(enc)
  -> S_vid: IEU_vid + SAU_vid(enc)

OGU step:
S_h pulls at most K_mod {y_hat_m, den_m, RJ_m, margin_m, ver_sau_m} from remote shards using cached PRF basis + pinned versions;
composes c_t, logits, sample, logs; pushes back control hints (lambda_* deltas, gate clamps) that are F_{t - 1}-measurable.

4.3 Audit aggregation (Merkle tree)
Each shard emits per-step merkle_curr^shard; AuditRoot periodically computes
merkle_root = H( concat_sorted( {merkle_curr^shard} , merkle_prev_root ) )
One-pass verifier replays shard streams independently and checks root continuity.

4.4 Snapshot / restore
Snapshots are per-shard; a periodic "syncpoint" stamps a cluster-wide version vector V = {ver_*^shard}. Restore selects a consistent V and replays from last checkpoints; session stickiness preserves causal order.

5. CONTROL PLANE (PREDICTABLE, CLUSTER-AWARE)
   5.1 Per-shard safety (as single-node spec)
    - SAU_m: maintain e-process; publish {margin_m, RJ_m}.
    - LMU: enforce scheduling inequality; log C_lookup/C_insert maxima, ring/stash occupancy.

5.2 Cluster-level RiskOrchestrator
Inputs: per-shard {margin_m, RJ_m, den_m stats}, LMU pressure signals.
Policy (predictable):
if exists modality m with persistent RJ "red" in last W steps:
raise beta_floor,m and lambda_*^m across all shards holding that modality (predictably effective from t+1 on those shards).
if LMU pressure (ring occupancy up or emergency used) at S_h:
lower tau_low(S_h) early; enqueue rebuild; optionally route a fraction of sessions to a warm spare (without moving the current session).
if net margins low cluster-wide:
global clamp: G_self_max <- down ; temperature cap <- down ; announce via control stream.

5.3 Backpressure / load shedding (constant-time)
Under overload on a remote modality shard:
 - Use last pinned y_hat_m for <= B steps (small fixed B).
 - If B exceeded, drop modality m from M_used (|M_used| remains <= K_mod).
 - Gate automatically reweights to available modalities and/or pure LMU fallback.
All decisions are logged, F_{t - 1}-measurable.

6. COMPLEXITY AND BOUNDS
   Per token on S_h (decoder):
    - 1 x SAU_txt self + up to K_mod cross SAU_m reads (RPC overlap)
    - 1 x LMU gate + 1 x LMU linear add-on
    - O(1) per token, constants scale with sum_{m in {self} union M_used} (r_m d_m + r_m d_v,m) on the involved shards.
   Per encoder token on S_m:
    - O(r_m d_m)+O(r_m d_v,m)+O(r_m) + O(#ids)*O(1) LMU.
   Cluster fan-out <= K_mod (fixed), fan-in <= 1 per selected modality -> network work is O(1) per token.

7. MULTIMODAL ENCODER DETAILS (PER MODALITY)
   7.1 Audio specifics
    - x_t^aud = mel-spec frame; normalize per-channel energy; PRF clip tuned by SNR bucket; emit LMU ids: SNR_bin, VAD_flag, speaker_id hash.
    - SAU_aud gamma_aud chosen from desired acoustic memory (e.g., 1 - 5s -> gamma ~ exp( - hop/tau_mem)).

7.2 Image specifics
 - Patch order fixed (scanline/space-filling curve) for reproducibility.
 - x_t^img augmented with position encodings; emit LMU ids: tile_xy bins, brightness/contrast bins.
 - Optional low-rank U_img for value compression.

7.3 Video specifics
 - Tubelets anchor on keyframes; cross-modal timecode alignment with audio/text.
 - LMU ids: motion bins, scene-cut flags.

7.4 Tabular/sensor
 - Row/event schema hashed into ids; missingness pattern id; units id; outlier flags; low-rank optional if many columns.

8. DECODER FUSION PATTERNS (SAFE AND INTERPRETABLE)
   8.1 Simplex gate (default):
   [G_self, {G_m}] on a simplex (sum=1, all >= 0), K_mod fixed. LMU learns logits u * z_t; softmax produces weights; clamps applied under risk.

8.2 Two-stage gate:
Stage-1 LMU predicts a mask over modalities (top-K with fixed K). Stage-2 LMU produces weights over the masked set. Both O(1).

8.3 Attention-as-feature:
Concatenate stabilized readouts y_hat_m and diagnostics into an LMU feature vector; LMU does final linear regression -> maximally interpretable.

9. PSEUDOCODE (CLUSTERED, MULTIMODAL)

9.1 IEU_m ingest (on shard S_m)
EncIngest_m(event e_t^m):
x = Embed_m(e_t^m)
k = W_k^m * x; v = W_v^m * x // or v_low = U_m^T * x
phi = PRF_m(k); phi = clip(phi)
R_m = gamma_m * R_m + GER_Kahan(phi, v^T)
s_m = gamma_m * s_m + KahanAdd(phi)
mu_m, sigma^2_m = EWM2_update(phi)
update_e_process_m(phi) // predictable
RJ_m = RJ_half_split_m()
emit_LMU_features_m(e_t^m, diag={den_m, RJ_m, margin_m})
AuditEmit_m(...)

9.2 OGU step (on S_h)
GenStep(prev_tok, ctx):
pin_versions({ver_sau_txt_dec, ver_base, ver_delta}, {ver_sau_m_enc for m in catalog})
q_self = QProj( Emb(prev_tok), ctx_state )
// self
phi_q = PRF_txt(q_self); phi_w = whiten(phi_q; sigma^2_txt_dec)
den_self = dot(phi_w, s_txt_dec) + lambda_*^self
y_hat_self = dot(phi_w, R_txt_dec) / den_self
RJ_self, margin_self = diag_dec()
// choose modalities (predictable)
M_used = SelectModalities(z_hist, fixed_K_mod) // e.g., {img,aud}
// remote cross reads (parallel RPCs)
Cross[m in M_used]:
phi_qm = PRF_m( CrossProj_m(q_self, ctx) )
phi_wm = whiten_m(phi_qm; sigma^2_m_enc)
den_m = dot(phi_wm, s_m_enc) + lambda_*^m
y_hat_m = dot(phi_wm, R_m_enc) / den_m
RJ_m, margin_m from last diag log
z_gate = Featurize(RJ_self, {RJ_m}, margin_self, {margin_m}, den_self, {den_m}, ||phi_w||*1, ctx)
G = LMU.Gate(z_gate) // O(1) exact
z_lin = LMU.Linear(x_dec_ids) // O(1) exact
c = G_self*y_hat_self + Sigma_m G_m*y_hat_m
logits = W_out * c + b_out + z_lin
(temp, topk, topp) = RiskToSampling(margin*=min(margins), RJ_self, {RJ_m})
y = Sample(logits, temp, topk, topp)
// safe, predictable control for next step
if margin* < 0 or RJ_red_persistent:
plan_raise(beta_floor,self/used); plan_raise(lambda**^self/used); plan_clamp(G); plan_temp_cap()
AuditEmit_h(...); return y

10. OBSERVABILITY AND AUDIT (TREE)
    Per-shard record (ASCII JSON):
    {
    t, shard_id, role:{IEU_m|OGU}, versions:{ver_sau_m, ver_base, ver_delta},
    PRF_seed_hash_m, hash_salt_hash, r_m, r_v_m, tau_m, gamma_m,
    rho_clip_m, RJ_m, margin_m, beta_floor_m, lambda_star_m,
    den_stats_m, kahan_residuals:{R,s,(H)}, saturation_events,
    LMU:{C_lookup_p100, C_insert_p100, ring_occ, stash_occ, emergency_used},
    rebuild_time_ms, slack_minus_arrivals, merkle_prev, merkle_curr
    }
    AuditRoot periodically publishes:
    { t_root, merkle_prev_root, sorted_leaf_hashes, merkle_root }
    Verifier:
     - Check root continuity and each leaf chain.
     - Check Ville margins >= 0 across shards; RJ policy adherence.
     - Check LMU step counts <= bounds; MPHF membership correctness sampling.
     - Optionally verify linear certificates.

11. SNAPSHOT / RESTORE (CLUSTER)
    Snapshot unit = shard. Manifest includes per-modality SAU blobs and LMU blobs + per-shard merkle_curr and cluster root at syncpoint. Restore picks a consistent version vector; sessions continue on their home shards; decoder resumes with pinned remote versions.

12. FAILURE MODES AND PLAYBOOKS
    12.1 Remote modality lag
    Action: use cached y_hat_m <= B steps; if exceeded, drop m from M_used; clamp G_m -> 0; bias toward self/text or LMU linear; log predictable actions.

12.2 Cluster-wide margin dip
Action: RiskOrchestrator issues global clamp and temperature cap; beta_floor and lambda_* raised predictably; LMU lr scaled down; announce horizon T if gamma ~ 1.

12.3 LMU pressure on any shard
Action: early rebuild (tau_low down ), parallelize builder, widen C next rollout, temporarily halve lr; if emergency fires, hard alarm and momentary insert freeze (reads unaffected) until swap completes.

12.4 Hot shard overload
Action: route only NEW sessions to warm spares; never move active session mid-decode; keep O(1) token path intact.

13. SECURITY / PRIVACY
     - PRF seeds and LMU hash salts in KMS; rotate per rebuild; never log plaintext.
     - WORM/append-only audit storage; per-tenant encryption and audit roots.
     - Modality PII redaction at IEU_m; only hashes/ids leak to LMU.
     - Optional content-safety LMU head as a hard gate (exact linear rules with robust Farkas certificates).

14. DEFAULTS (GOOD FIRST RUN)
     - r_txt=1024, r_v,txt=64; r_img=1024, r_v,img=64; r_aud=768, r_v,aud=64; r_vid=512, r_v,vid=64.
     - gamma_txt,dec ~ 0.99; gamma_enc per modality set from desired memory horizon.
     - K_mod=2 (pick best two remote modalities).
     - LMU: d=2,b=4,S=8,L=8,Q=16; tau_low=0.6, tau_high=0.8; C s.t. slack >= 2 x (p99 lambda_max T_rb).
     - beta_floor_m ~ 1e - 6..1e - 4; clip c_m tuned to rho_clip ~ 0.5%.

15. END-TO-END SLOS
     - p99 latency <= 2 x p50 per token on S_h; remote RPC bounded by K_mod fixed calls.
     - Exactness: LMU equals reference linear (ULP-scale diffs only).
     - SAU error: O(r_m^{-1/2}) uniform in time for gamma_m<1; margins anytime-valid.
     - Availability: no reader pauses; atomic publication; O(1) hot path preserved under all policies.

16. WHY THIS WORKS
     - Constant fan-in/out keeps per-token cluster work O(1).
     - Per-modality SAU gives stabilized, length-free attention; LMU gives exact, auditable linearity.
     - Predictable control (margins, RJ) modulates gates, denominators, temperatures without violating martingale guarantees or RCU invariants.
     - The audit tree and deterministic snapshots make the entire distributed multimodal computation replayable.

17. CHECKLIST (BRING-UP)
    [ ] Per-modality IEU_m + SAU_m online (gamma_m, r_m sized; clipping logged).
    [ ] LMU O(1) bounds verified under load; scheduling inequality satisfied.
    [ ] ShardRouter sticky routing; ModalColocator places heavy modalities near decoder.
    [ ] RiskOrchestrator thresholds announced; actions logged predictably.
    [ ] AuditRoot producing stable merkle_root; verifier passes.
    [ ] Snapshot/restore drill; warm-spare switchover tested.

18. TL;DR
    Distribute each modality's constant-time memory (SAU_m) across shards, keep the decoder/session sticky, read a fixed small number of remote memories per token, and let an exact linear LMU gate fuse them under tight risk controls. Everything is O(1) per token on each node, reversible, and auditable end-to-end.
